            "body": "BENGALURU, June 6 - German drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE) said it was facing supply issues with its popular oral-contraceptive pill Yasmin in India, without giving a reason, and that supply would resume in the \"next few days\".\n\nAbout 40 Indian pharmacies and drug distributors told Reuters that Yasmin, the No.2 combination oral-contraceptive pill in the country, has been in short supply since March.\n\nYasmin, made from a combination of female hormones ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone, is manufactured locally by Bayer Zydus Pharma, a joint venture between Bayer's Singapore unit and India's Zydus Lifesciences (ZYDU.NS).\n\nUnit sales of Yasmin, also prescribed to treat irregular periods tied to polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), have slid 48% from January to April, according to market research firm Pharmarack AWACS.\n\n\"We faced temporary supply issues for Yasmin in India and have also intimated this to healthcare practitioners,\" a Bayer spokesperson said by email.\n\nThey did not say what caused the shortage but said the pill would be available in the \"next few days\", without elaborating.\n\nThe drugstore operators that Reuters spoke with said they were unaware of the reason for the shortage, nor when the pill would be available next. No shortages have been reported in other countries so far.\n\nIn March, Bayer said it would shift the focus of its drug research away from women's health, one of its traditional pillars, to focus on neurology, rare diseases and immunology.\n\nIn India, Yasmin competes with drugs including Sun Pharma's (SUN.NS) market-leading Dronis as well as Cipla's (CIPL.NS) Crisanta and Lupin's (LUPN.NS) Yamini.\n\nYasmin accounted for 26% of the market for combination oral contraceptives, which was worth 1 billion rupees ($12.11 million) as of April 2023, per Pharmarack AWACS. The overall oral contraceptive market is pegged at 5.07 billion rupees.\n\nThe Drugs Controller General of India, Sun Pharma, Lupin and Cipla did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. ($1 = 82.5941 Indian rupees)",

            "title": "What are the implications of the govt's ban on 14 fixed-dose combination drugs?",
            "body": "Most analysts do not see the drug ban materially impacting financials for drugmakers.\n\nThe Indian government recently banned the 14 fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs, citing a lack of therapeutic justification and potential risks to individuals. FDCs are medications containing multiple active drug ingredients prescribed for specific diseases.\n\nOne of the popular FDCs on the banned list is nimesulide+paracetamol, commonly used to alleviate pain associated with toothache, ear pain, joint pain, headache, menstrual cramps and fever. Another combination that has been banned is amoxicillin+bromhexidine, typically prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections. The ban particularly targeted drugs in the cough and cold segment, including combinations with codeine, an opioid pain reliever.\n\nThe moves come against the backdrop of recent incidents of deaths linked to the use of cough syrups exported from India, which raised concerns about the scrutiny of Indian drug regulators and affected the reputation of Indian pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe ban will result in several popular over-the-counter drugs being removed from the market, including well-known cough syrups like Mankind's Codistar and Tedykoff, and Glenmark's Ascoril C. While the list also targets some drugs with sizeable market share, analysts do not see the ban causing much disruption in revenues for companies.\n\n\"Among the companies that saw their drugs in the banned list, Alkem Laboratories, Mankind Pharma and Abbott India are likely to feel a 1-2 percent impact on their revenues,\" said Mitesh Shah, pharma research analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.\n\nAs for others like Cipla or Glenmark, the impact is unlikely to be materially significant, Shah added. He also pointed towards another roadblock that will be triggered by the drug ban. \"As the DGCI (Drugs Controller General of India) turns more cautious of the FDC drugs available in the market, the ban is also expected to result in much tighter scrutiny in receiving drug approvals at the state level.\"\n\nAlso Read: Govt bans 14 cocktail drugs for posing health risks, lack of therapeutic justification\n\nBino Pathiparampil, head of research at Elara Capital, seconded the view that the drug ban will not have a material impact on many listed companies. However, he does believe that the move will have adverse implications for players that are unlisted.\n\n\"Generally it is the unlisted players that have difficulties around safety and compliance when it comes to drug regulations. Listed companies tend to have their quality checks under control and, hence, the ban will not make things any more difficult for them,\" Pathiparampil added.\n\nGiven that the recent news of people dying due to the use of Indian cough syrups has been also attributed to lapses at small, unlisted pharma companies, some analysts also believe that the step to tighten regulations is in the right direction.",

            "body": "Amid several reports of untimely deaths and diseases raised due to consumption of contaminated Indian drugs, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) inspectors kept an eye on the pharma industries of India, and have leaked out some gruesome revelations.\n\nThe world's biggest supplier of cheap medicine is facing a series of red flags from the USFDA concerning filthy conditions in production facilities, unattended customer complaints, shredded paperwork, poorly trained staff, and topping it all off, the supply of contaminated drugs to the United States.\n\nAs the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have died down, the officials from the federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services are frequenting their visits to different drug makers in the Indian base, besides issuing warnings and notices to dozens of pharma factories on uncovering wide range of lapses in some of the renowned pharma firms of the country.\n\nThe 50 billion dollar worth pharma sector of India, which is the largest supplier of generic drugs to more than 200 countries across the globe including the U.S., has been scandalized with a number of pharma defaults, thanks to the privately-owned smaller pharmaceutical establishments in the nation.\n\nThis slew of extensive failure involves, but is not restricted to, the adulterated cough syrup which claimed the lives of a number of children in Uzbekistan and Gambia, and the tainted chemotherapy medications exported to the U.S.\n\nWhat's more, USFDA reported that as a consequence of the pandemic restrains observed worldwide, factory audits in some of the Indian pharma manufacturing units had been suspended for almost two consecutive years, which liberalized the working conditions, giving way to the emergence of as many glitches as possible.\n\nA crucial observation to be registered is the saddening depth of insincerity that is concealed within the Indian pharmaceutical companies.\n\nYear 2022 registered a 74 per cent decline in the overseas inspection in contrast to the 1204 reviews held in 2019, the pre-pandemic year. Whereas, this year has witnessed a mere 245 authority visit.\n\nAcross the world, a backlog of 1000 plus foreign drug-plant audits created due to the pandemic are being seen through the U.S. officials presently, signifying that the latest blunders surfaced and reported in the Indian pharma will not be its last.\n\nIf prima facie, the external factory audits from the international regulatory bodies were not able to be conducted, citing the worldwide restrictions due to pandemic, why did the Indian regulatory bodies back out from adhering to their duties and responsibilities of carrying out timely audits to keep a check on the factories, whether small or large?\n\nPerhaps, if at least the audits had been executed periodically whether internally or through a national regulatory body, virtually or by offline mode, was it not capable enough to ward off the incompetency's that arose in the culpable pharma production facilities, by means of issuing suspension or strict non-compliance for deviating against the regulatory frameworks set for the pharmaceutical companies in India?\n\nWhy did the Indian pharma companies had to kick their heels for the USFDA to turn up and document a string of deadly manufacturing mishaps?\n\nDid the authorities forget that the main aim of pharmaceutical companies is to cure a person from their disease and not harm them, and rack their brains on the number of exports India makes in the pharma sector is not to ultimately shine out of the pack but to nurture a healthy planet?\n\nPublic health activities have time and again come upfront raising their voices against the dozens of scandals taking place in the pharma sector, but to no avail. Recommendations for stringent regulations and re-evaluation of supply chains on a global basis has been echoing all over the market, but who wants to hear.\n\nIs the Indian Pharma really on doldrums or is it being sabotaged for a wider reason?\n\nThe eye-opening revelations that have come to picture is terribly horrifying and dismaying on part of the Indian agencies, and is a wake up call for the country to act while the time is still at hand.\n\nCOVID-19 has already seen a deadly number of deaths, the last two years have been nothing more than funeral grounds for all the countries. Would the fallacies in the Indian pharma industry be the next to claim such enormous amount of lives, both of its citizens and of its dependent nations?\n\nJune 2023: Gujarat based Indiana Ophthalmics, registered as a small scale manufacturer, has been warned of suspension of export license by Pharmexcil for causing trust deficit and bringing bad reputation after the island nation of Sri Lanka reported eye infections in 30 people, linked to the Indian-made eyedrop.\n\nJune 2023: Intas Pharmaceuticals Ahmedabad has been put under import alert by US inspectors, stating a cascade of failure ranging from data integrity to inadequate documentation practices and poor test methods for prevention of microbial contamination. Be that as may, around 20 products have found an exception due to a 5-year high shortage of the same drugs in the U.S. base, with the exports to be approved batch-by-batch by the federal drug regulators.\n\nApril 2023: Sun Pharma in Mohali violated 3 major regulations that comprised of manufacturing of drug against chronic angina in spite of failing dissolution results from 2021-2022; documentation failure for deviating from laboratory control mechanisms; and inadequate investigations circling around unexplained drug discrepancies. The federal agency strictly asked the Pharma firm to mandatorily seek the signatures of the USFDA officials before exporting the drug batches for at least one year. The Mohali factory contributes to 100 million dollars annual sales out of the total 150 million dollars of the U.S. business of Sun Pharma.\n\nMarch 2023: FDA inspectors found that a factory outlet of Lupin Ltd. in Pithampur, allegedly investigated only 48 reports out of the 1759 breakdown notifications, cumulated between a period of January 2019 to March 2023. However, Lupin addressed that comprehensive measures are underway to maintain the quality and compliance in all the manufacturing units.\n\nFebruary 2023: Chennai-based unlisted Global Pharma Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. exported eye drops and ointment to the U.S. in February. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention found out in June 2023 of the subsequent repercussions generated by the shipped products. Eyeballs of four people had to be surgically removed because of the eye drops, 14 cases were linked to vision losses, and 4 reported deaths, along side 81 drug-resistant bacterial infections. Upon inspection by the USFDA, the manufacturing plant of the ointment boasted of quality failures and sterility incompetency.\n\nFebruary 2023: Cipla Ltd. fell into USFDA's microscope for failing at good documentation practices in Pithampur. Between 2020 and 2022, Cipla had received more than 3000 customer complaints from the products it shipped to U.S., yet effective corrective actions were missing on their part. What aggravated the fault even more is their document shredding with original lab records and customer complaint reports being piled up in bags of scrap. Nevertheless, Cipla proclaimed that examination of all data had been taken care of, and more strong and efficacious documentation system is being planned.\n\nFebruary 2023: WHO claimed that more than 300 pediatric deaths have been reported since August 2022 across Marshall Islands, Uzbekistan, Micronesia and the Gambia due to substandard Indian-made cough syrups which tragically contained toxic elements like ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol.\n\nDecember 2022: Sun Pharma located in Halol faced an import alert from USFDA after failing to meet the dissolution specifications of the capsules and non-compliance to good manufacturing practices. Also, unkempt cleaning of the equipment used in the manufacturing units of drugs, as well as water leaks added to the woes, that was reportedly overlooked since 2014. Under certain conditions, the Halol unit recovered a clean chit for 14 of their products, and continues to export to other nations post January.\n\nIn 2019, USFDA had proclaimed to the U.S. Congress that out of all the nations it policed, the inspection of the drug manufacturing facilities in the Indian subcontinent was deemed to have the lowest acceptable standards of a mere 83 per cent.\n\nAlthough comprehensive breakdown of the report was not provided, yet it acclaimed China to be ranking on the second lowest industry standards of 90 per cent, which was swiftly followed at 93 per cent by the U.S., and the European Union stood at 98 per cent of acceptable inspection outcomes.\n\nIndian drug makers have been persistently on the front burner since the beginning of 2022, after USFDA had issued them with an aggregate of 9 warning letters. This could be a significant reason for the U.S. not letting in any more drugs from the Indian base.\n\nIndia has only been second to Mexico in the overseas segment for the issuance of such admonishments from the USFDA. A lot of Indian pharma companies have received a big blow from the USFDA in the form of Form 483 for potential violations in regulatory policies.\n\nTaking up actions against the cough syrup deaths caused by Indian medicines, the Indian authorities have turned down the licenses of 6 unlisted drug makers, served show-cause notices to 17 firms for violation of rules, whereas WHO directly extended a ban on 4 India-made cough and cold syrups over toxicity.\n\nPost suspension, the authorities have not released public details on the reinstating process of the companies under scrutiny.\n\nFurther, from the start of this month, it has been mandatory for all the cough syrup makers in the country to obtain a certificate of analysis from a government approved laboratory before dwelling into their exports.\n\nWhilst the Narendra Modi led government solicits the investors to invest in the high-quality manufacturing products of the Indian pharma, opposing the competition from Chinese regime, the medicine recalls and fatalities due to cynical deformities consistently materializing in the pharmaceutical plants across the nation disembarks as a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Biden administration in the U.S. has imposed warnings related to the import of pharmaceuticals profusely from India, and has started promoting the production of a myriad of American drugs in their home country itself.\n\nInto the bargain, investors are stepping back from investing in the Indian pharma firms, thanks to the skeleton in the cupboards, which has ridiculously been spotlighted under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nA London based fund manager, Alice Wang from Quaero Capital LLP has ubiquitously exclaimed that a reality check needs to be done before investing in manufacturing spaces of high-value-precision, whereas India lags behind its neighbor China in many hefty ways.\n\nThanks to the back-to-back allegations and defaults in the Indian pharma industry, the stocks of the top firms in the Healthcare Index has also started to fall off with 9.6 per cent abasement just the start of it, noticed during 2022.",

Most of the market participants expect the RBI's rate setting panel to hold rates steady for second time in a row as inflation has been trending below its upper end of tolerance band of 6 per cent since last two months. Meanwhile, they added that all eyes will be on what policy stance the central bank adopts.\n\nAs of 9:32 am, the Sensex was up 16 points at 62,803 and Nifty 50 index advanced 8 points to 18,601.\n\nThe MPC had continuously raised rates for six times in a row starting with an off cycle rate hike in May 2022 tracking spike in inflation which soared after Russian invasion of Ukraine. The RBI has collectively raised repo rate by 250 basis points to 6.5 per cent before hitting a pause button in April after inflation cooled down to 18-month low of 4.7 per cent.\n\nIn the last MPC decision on April 6, the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das while pausing the rate hike cycle said that it was a tactical decision and not a pivotal one and added that the RBI will would continue to monitor all incoming information and undertake a forward-looking assessment of the evolving economic outlook.\n\nThe RBI paused the rate hike cycle but did not change its policy stance from \"withdrawal of accommodation\".\n\nMeanwhile on Dalal Street, 11 of fifteen sector gauges compiled by the National Stock Exchange were trading higher led by the Nifty Auto index's 0.4 per cent gain. Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Metal, Realty, Consumer Durables and Private Bank indices were also trading marginally higher.\n\nOn the other hand, IT, media, select PSU bank and healthcare shares were facing selling pressure.\n\nMid- and small-cap shares were trading on a mixed note as Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.04 per cent while Nifty Smallcap 100 index advanced 0.2 per cent.\n\nUltraTech Cement was top Nifty gainer, the stock rose 2 per cent to Rs 8,030. Adani Enterprises, Titan, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, Grasim, UPL, Bajaj Finserv and Adani Ports also rose between 0.6-1.3 per cent.\n\nOn the flipside, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, TCS, Cipla, Apollo Hospitals, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the losers.\n\nThe overall market breadth was positive as 1,952 shares were advancing while 931 were declining on the BSE.",

            "title": "Uganda: Quality Chemicals Boss Katongole Shares Story of How Rotary Meeting Changed His Life",
            "body": "It is not every day that a prominent Ugandan business personality shares their life story as candidly as Cipla Quality Chemicals Industries chairman Emmanuel Katongole recently did.\n\nHowever, last week, during the Rotary International Convention in Melbourne Australia meet, Katongole opened up about his journey to the top.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Katongole is the executive chairman of Cipla Quality Chemical Industries Ltd. He is also the chairman of Uganda National Oil Company and of course an estemmed member of the Rotary Club of Muyenga, Kampala.\n\nBelow is the moving speech of his rise in business that he shared with his Rotary family...\n\n\"Good morning my Rotary Family.\n\nOver the years, Rotary has transformed millions of people around the world. I am one of them.\n\nThank you, President Jennifer Jones for giving me an opportunity to share my story.\n\nI am a Ugandan born in 1962.\n\nMy parents were both illiterate village peasants. My Father worked as a labourer at a tea estate while my Mother worked as a domestic servant to Church missionaries. I was the last child after 3 girls.\n\nLooking for an opportunity, My Father moved to Kampala city where he got a better job as a construction site potter.\n\nIn May 1966, he went to work and never returned. It is believed he was shot dead during the Uganda Military conflict under Idi Amin.\n\nMy Mother could not afford to keep the 4 of us in our tree shed and grass thatched school. In 1969, she removed my 3 sisters from school to concentrate on me.\n\nI spent much of my childhood doing odd jobs including selling roasted corn by the roadside. My evenings and weekends were spent herding goats & guarding them against hyenas.\n\nMeanwhile, my sisters were caught up in absolute poverty. The oldest got pregnant at age 15. She carried the pregnancy to term but there was no money to take her to the nearest birth attendant. She bled to death. My other two sisters later died of HIV/AIDS.\n\nI lived a lonely life with my Mother in our grass thatched hut, but the long hours of work paid off when I excelled in my Primary school exams.\n\nUnfortunately, we could not afford College education. We gave up until my first Rotary moment set in. I was picked by good Samaritans including a Rotary member who helped me to study and eventually graduated from Makerere University, one of Africa's best Universities and home to our Rotary Peace Center.\n\nSadly, my Mother soon after died of cancer. I was scared and frightened that I would be the next and last in my family to die.\n\nLuckily, I got a spouse who became the Rock of my love and Mother to our children. They inspired me to be part of the solution to the diseases that were killing millions of Ugandans. These were HIV/AIDS, malaria & cancer.\n\nI co-founded a pharmaceutical company. We did not have enough money and therefore started the business within Uganda's biggest slum.\n\nMy second Rotary moment came when a Rotarian connected me to an Indian pharmaceutical giant Cipla Ltd for partnership.\n\nThis business has grown and manufactures HIV/AIDS and malaria medicines. We employ over 600 professionals and supply our medicines to 20 African countries. About 2 million people in Africa are surviving because of our HIV/AIDS medicines.\n\nIn Uganda, we have reduced the number of people dying of Malaria from over 400 per day to less than 50 and our dream is to get it to zero. These earned me an induction into the 2013 World Entrepreneur of the year Hall of Fame.\n\nNot sure how my past takes credit for joining Rotary, however, the help from Rotarians has enabled my journey. One writer said, \"The most beautiful people are those who have known defeat, suffering, struggle, loss and have found their way out of the depth\". I am a proud byproduct of Rotary.\n\nThrough Rotary I am determined to pay backwards and forward. About to reach my second AKS and growing.\n\nI helped build a Rotary Blood Bank that closed a 27% blood transfusion shortage in Uganda. I was key to setting up Makerere University Rotary Peace Centre and I am the Team Leader of the TRF Peace Major Gifts Initiative. Friends, all the above is what you receive when Rotary gives hope to hopeless situations like mine.\n\nMy history and Rotary inspire me do more for Humanity because I know what it means to live in extreme poverty and privilege; the difference is huge. It is our responsibility to bridge this gap. Rotary is the best vehicle to channel our humanitarian efforts and make a change.\n\nAs we leave Melbourne, let us all go out and inspire Humanity. Let us continue imagining Rotary and as we do so, we will create hope in the World.\n\nHistory will favour us. The next generation will be proud of us and a better World will be there because of our actions.",

            "title": "Nuvama Institutional Equities sees limited earnings risk for pharma sector",
            "body": "Analysing the trends emerging from the fourth quarter results of pharma companies, brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities sees limited earnings risk for drug makers in the quarters to come. The optimism for Nuvama is fueled by signs of steady growth in the Indian market, normalisation in US price erosion, and reducing input costs, trends that were seen across the industry in Q4. \"The following factors also aided 16 percent/29 percent sales/EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth on year for the pharma sectors, partly supported by revenues from gRevlimid,\" Nuvama highlighted in its report. Also Read: Delayed drug launches to hurt Cipla's earnings in FY24 Moreover, over the last three quarter, the pharma sector saw 9 percent/4 percent PAT (Profit after tax) downgrade, which also limits the scope of much pressure hereon. That said, Nuvama does see regulatory challenges as an overhang for the pharma industry. As for the hits and misses in the fourth-quarter earnings season, Nuvama picked Zydus Lifesciences, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Torrent Pharma as clear winners. The broking firm was impressed by Sun Pharma's potential to report strong numbers despite the import alert on its Halol plant. Also Read: Dr Reddy's fall 5% even after Q4 net profit jumps 10-fold. Here's why On the other hand, Torrent Pharma's strong India and Brazil, and margin aided growth while Zydus Life won over the Street with its superlative US (gRevlimid and gTrokendi), steady India revenue and high value launches which drove its margin. Following the quarterly results, the only major rating change that Nuvama initiated within the pharma sector was that of Divi's Laboratories. The broking firm downgraded Divi's to 'reduce' citing pressure on its core business. Also Read: Why are brokerages divided over Torrent Pharma's outlook despite a strong Q4 show? \"Biocon, Cipla, Natco saw maximum earnings cut which were on expected lines (Cipla launch delays due to plant issues and Biocon integration) while Zydus Life (strong results) saw earnings increase,\" the firm highlighted. Nuvama also noted that several pharma companies were increasingly investing on field force expansion and marketing to drive volume growth in India along with higher research and development spending to build global pipeline. Another emerging trend that Nuvama underlined was the higher allocation of capital towards branded business, which is to ensure double-digit growth in the coming quarters. Aside from this, the broking firm also played up the strong double-digit growth seen for most players while also putting focus on the mixed trend when it came to gross margins. While a negative impact of high input costs for some raw materials weighed on players like Divis and Ipca, followed by Lupin and Aurobindo, others like Sun Pharma, Cipla and Dr Reddy's showed remarkable improvement in the last three quarters. To round it all up, Nuvama chose industry leader Sun Pharma because of its robust specialty segment and Torrent Pharma due to its strong India business as the top picks within the sector.

Lyophilization is a process based on negative temperatures, the product's activity, and stability, along with active ingredients that are retained while limiting any damage to the product and avoiding any degradation of the molecules. Thus, freeze-drying is especially popular in the pharmaceutical & diagnostic sectors. The increased quality and extended shelf life of lyophilized injectable drugs created growth opportunities for manufacturers to implement the lyophilization process in product manufacturing. The contract manufacturing and research services are in huge demand, delivering lyophilized injectable drugs to offer high-quality products to the end users.\n\nGet Exclusive Sample PDF @: https://www.premiummarketinsights.com/sample/TIP00073609 (Kindly Use Corporate Mail ID To Get More Details)\n\nThe List of Companies -\n\nThe increasing demand for contract research manufacturing services, rising approvals of pharmaceuticals, and growing demand for biologics drive the growth of the market. However, high product recalls hamper the market growth.\n\nMoreover, many pharmaceutical companies are refocusing on their core capabilities, such as research and development, leading to divestments of in-house manufacturing capacities, which is propelling the demand for contract research manufacturing services (CRAMs) for manufacturing. Furthermore, CRAMs play crucial roles to mitigate the risk of supply shortages by offering additional sites for pharmaceutical companies with multisite supply strategies and backup capacities. For instance, in 2019, Samsung Biologics and GI Innovation signed a contract for immunochemotherapy. Under the agreement, Samsung Biologics provided services ranging from the development of cell line to the production of Phase I drug substances.\n\nThere was an unusual demand for Remdesivir, an antiviral medicine used to treat patients, during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. Manufacturers in the lyophilized injectables market are preparing for the future by keeping adequate supply chains to avoid any COVID-19-like vulnerabilities. Gilead Sciences and other big pharma companies received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US FDA for the use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further, in May 2020, Gilead Sciences Inc. extended a voluntary nonexclusive license to Cipla to manufacture and market Cipla's generic version of remdesivir called CIPREMI. Companies are utilizing government programs and financing schemes given by the BFSI industry to streamline their operations in response to turbulent market conditions. For instance, in May 2020, the US government entered an agreement with a group of American generic medicine manufacturers potentially worth US$ 812 million to bolster the country's drug supply amid the pandemic. Thus, the growing demand for drugs due to the COVID-19 pandemic bolstered the global lyophilized injectable market.\n\nGet full Report Description, TOC, Table of Figure, Chart, etc. @: https://www.premiummarketinsights.com/reports-tip/lyophilized-injectable-market\n\nGeography-Based Insights\n\nNorth America holds the largest share of the global lyophilized injectable market, whereas Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region.

            "title": "Why govt has banned 14 drugs including some paracetamol combination meds",
            "body": "The Government of India has banned 14 Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) drugs, including a few drugs comprised of paracetamol and codeine syrup, with immediate effect. A notification to this effect was issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on June 2. Fixed Dose Combination or FDC drugs are combination drugs, which contain one or more medicinal ingredients used to treat a particular indication or symptom. Most of the drugs in the Health Ministryâ€™s list are ones used to treat cough, coldm and fever symptoms.\n\nThis ban was first announced back in March 10, 2016, when the government back banned 344 FDC drugs, which included these 14 drugs. However, more than 30 pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Alkem Laboratories, Glenmark, Procter and Gamble (P&G) and Cipla challenged this ban at the Delhi High Court. The HC, on December 1, 2016, quashed the ban, following which the government moved the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court set aside the HC order and referred that the drugs be re-examined by a Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB). An expert committee was formed as per the SCâ€™s directions which looked into the drugs and submitted a report on April 2022.\n\nAccording to the notification gazette published on June 2, the expert committee in its report submitted on April 1, 2022, had recommended that â€œthere is no therapeutic justificationâ€ for the 14 FDCS banned, and that these combination drugs â€œmay involve risk to human beings.â€ Hence, in the larger public interest, it is necessary to prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of this FDC under section 26 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940,â€ the expert committee said in the case of the 14 banned combination drugs, according to the notification.\n\nâ€œIn view of the above, any kind of regulation or restriction to allow for any use in patients is not justifiable. Therefore, only prohibition under Section 26A is recommended,â€ the notification said, referring to the expert committeeâ€™s recommendations. Section 26A is related to the powers of the Union Government to regulate, restrict or prohibit manufacture, etc., of a drug or cosmetic product â€œin public interestâ€. As per the recent Health Ministry notification, the following FDC drugs are banned in India:\n\n> Chlorpheniramine maleate + Dextromethorphan + Guaiphenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol\n\n> Chlopheniramine Maleate + Codeine Syrup\n\n> Ammomium Chloride + Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan\n\n> Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol\n\n> Dextromethorphan + Chlorpheniramine + Guaiphenesin + Ammonium Chloride\n\n> Paracetamol + Bromhexine+ Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine + Guaiphenesin\n\nSalbutamol + Bromhexine\n\n> Chlorpheniramine + Codeine Phosphate + Menthol Syrup\n\n> Phenytoin + Phenobarbitone sodium\n\n> Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol (100mg + 40mg + 2.5mg + 0.9mg) , (125mg + 55mg + 4mg + 1mg) , (110mg + 46mg + 3mg + 0.9mg) & (130mg + 55mg + 3mg + 0.5mg) per 5ml syrup\n\n> Salbutamol + Hydroxyethyltheophylline (Etofylline) + Bromhexine",

            "body": "These episodes have encompassed distressing incidents like the deaths of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan due to adulterated cough syrup, contaminated chemotherapy drugs and contaminated eye drops causing blindness. Triggered by these events, public health campaigners across the globe are urging for stricter monitoring and a reconsideration of global supply chains.\n\nALSO READ | Centre Probes Gujarat Pharma Firm Over Its Eyedrops Being Linked to Vision-damage Cases in Sri Lanka\n\nIn the last few months, pharmaceuticals export arm Pharmexcil and the ministry of commerce and industry have expressed significant concerns regarding these incidents and raised the issue with the ministry of health and family welfare as well as the department of pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"We have asked the health ministry to do something that sends a strong message to global regulators that we are serious about fixing these lapses and we are on it,\" a senior government official said.\n\nDriven by this, India also made a move by bringing in additional checks over cough syrups meant for exports. But it will require a significantly greater effort to resolve this chaotic situation than what we have currently invested.\n\nUnfortunately, these incidents are tarnishing India's reputation in the global arena. Also, a majority of these incidents have been announced by the World Health Organization, including the deaths of children in Gambia, contaminated cough syrup in the Marshall Islands and circulation of contaminated anti-cancer drugs in Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nALSO READ | Gambia-Uzbekistan By-product: India Initiates System of Checking Cough Syrups in Govt Labs before Exporting\n\nSuch frequent alerts by WHO are serious and embarrassing unless we prefer to live in denial and opt to maintain the theory of \"witch hunting\" against India. Global media is also increasingly adopting a harsh and critical tone.\n\nFinancial Times labelled the Gambia incident as \"the world's worst scandal related to the sales of over-the-counter medicines\". Bloomberg, an American news agency, in its latest article on the spate of deadly manufacturing incidents labelled these events \"scandals\".\n\n\"The deaths and drug recall also come at a critical time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is selling the South Asian nation to investors as an alternative to China for high-quality manufacturing,\" the article stated. \"The Biden administration has warned about the preponderance of drug supplies from countries like India, and pushed to produce more medicine domestically.\"\n\nA top government officer, in an informal conversation, told me that India must move away from the concept of \"medium and small enterprises\" in drug manufacturing to end the series of shameful and awkward lapses.\n\n\"We should not allow any firm to manufacture drugs if their turnover is below Rs 200 crore. Maintaining quality needs a lot of money. Running a firm to match US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) standards is an extremely expensive process,\" the officer said.\n\nThe officer further said India must stop taking pride in promoting medium and small scale firms in the pharmaceutical industry. \"Thank god, these small players do not export to heavily regulated markets in Europe and North America,\" the officer added.\n\nIn hindsight, it may sound apt.\n\nSample this: It was the Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceutical drug maker behind the cough syrup controversy in the Gambia case, whereas Noida-based Marion Biotech was behind the Uzbekistan cough syrup-related deaths.\n\nHealth authorities in Lebanon and Yemen red-flagged a cancer drug made by Celon Labs in Hyderabad, whereas Punjab-based QP Pharmachem has been blamed for exporting contaminated cough syrup to the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.\n\nBut in an aerial view, issues within India's pharmaceutical industry extend way beyond small manufacturers. Since the beginning of 2022, Indian drugmakers have been issued nine FDA warning letters, and a majority of these drugmakers are India's top pharma firms.\n\nFrom questioning the safety and efficacy of drugs to pointing out the documentation practices, Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla among others have come under the radar of the American regulator deemed to be the world's strictest.\n\nIn January, the US health regulator, pulled up Sun Pharma for manufacturing lapses that included failure to follow certain processes to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products. Similarly, for Lupin's Tarapur plant, the FDA said in the warning letter: \"Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API is adulterated...\"\n\nFrom upgrading Schedule M to regulate good manufacturing practices (GMP), tightening surveillance and enforcement of violations, increasing audits and putting additional checks before the final rollout of products for export or local market - it's time for India to bounce back urgently if it still wants to claim the mantle of the \"pharmacy to the world\". Fixing quality issues is no more an urgency but an emergency.",

            "body": "Hyderabad : The 9th edition of PharmaLytica, a premier pharmaceutical exhibition, commenced with an unwavering commitment to adapt to the changing healthcare landscape, and meet dynamic patient and business requirements. Organised by Informa Markets in India, the three-day event is taking place at HITEX, Hyderabad, hosting over 150 exhibitors. Allied to South Asia's largest Pharma event, the CPhI & P-MEC India show, PharmaLytica is expected to witness over 6000 domestic and international visitors from 16 countries and 21 Indian states, and approximately 250 delegates over the duration of the expo.\n\nThis event serves as a testament to India's vision of becoming the pharmacy of the world, providing a platform that contributes significantly to achieving this ambitious objective. The future of pharma will leverage Robotics and Digitalization to a significantly high degree. These include the use of automated systems, data analytics, and cloud-based architecture, which attendees can witness at PharmaLytica 2023.\n\nThe Event had participation from key stakeholders from the Pharmaceutical Industry including Chief Guest Shri Jayesh Ranjan, IAS, Principal Secretary, Industries & Commerce Dept, Government of Telangana; R.K. Agrawal, National President, Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India (BDMAI); Harish Jain, President, Karnataka Drugs & Pharmaceutical Manufactures (KDPMA); Avinash Kumar Talwar, Vice President, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Shankar Gupta, Chief Sales Officer, ACG; Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India and Rahul Deshpande, Senior Group Director, Informa Markets in India.\n\nHighlighting the importance of technology, Shri Jayesh Ranjan, IAS, Principal Secretary, Industries & Commerce Dept, Government of Telangana said, \"The pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical devices industry in Telangana has experienced remarkable growth, surpassing initial expectations. Initially projected to reach $100 billion in ten years, the industry has already reached a substantial size of $80 billion, prompting a revision of the target to $250 billion. This buoyancy reflects the industry's potential and highlights the need for the sector to showcase advanced and sophisticated technologies, moving beyond bulk manufacturing. The pharmaceutical industry plays a pivotal role as part of the government's \"Atmanirbhar\" strategy, necessitating introspection and revaluation to propel further growth. Additionally, the increasing importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, driven primarily by European buyers, is shaping the future trajectory of the pharmaceutical sector. The industry must prioritize the integration of cutting-edge knowledge and technology into their processes, and participants in this exhibition will greatly benefit from the extensive showcase of advanced technology, equipment, and machinery.\"\n\nR.K. Agrawal, National President, BDMAI said, \"The pharmaceutical industry is moving towards transparency and visibility, where maintain comprehensive and digitalized records becomes imperative to showcase processes, testing and manufacturing to regulatory authorities during audits. Further, automation and technological advancements contribute to increased efficiency and reduced reliance on manual labor. Despite a highly regulated industry, with approximately 30 Government Departments monitoring operations, the Pharma sector has embraced stringent pollution norms, resulting in improved conditions within pharmaceutical plants. Furthermore, the Indian Government's supportive policies such as streamlining regulatory processes, promoting research and development, and encouraging investments create a conducive environment for industry growth. India is already being recognized as the Pharmacy of the world, and the country is a net exporter of drugs to over 195 countries, which is widely accepted. The sector was growing at a rate of 5% during the Pandemic, and now expected to grow at a rate of 8 to 10%. The Indian drug industry can provide good quality drugs at an affordable price thereby changing the landscape of affordability by providing anti-viral drugs at 1/10th of price to countries like Africa. Bulk Drugs constitute 25% ($15 Billion) of the Indian Pharma industry. Also, once the new Pharma City comes up in Telangana, investment of more than INR. 15000-20000 crores are easily possible by the local API manufacturers, which will further attract more FDI.\"\n\nFocused on achieving the aspirational growth, Harish Jain, President, Karnataka Drugs and Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (KDPMA), said, \"India's aspirations in the pharmaceutical industry go beyond its current ranking of 14th in value. The aim is to break into the top five and elevate its position in the value chain. While India is poised for a substantial 8 to 10% volume growth, the focus lies on achieving aspirational growth through innovation rather than traditional generics. This entails embracing new drug delivery systems to propel the industry forward. Research and development, along with awareness of cutting-edge equipment and testing methods, play a crucial role in realizing this vision. Events like PharmaLytica serve to enhance awareness about the latest advancements in equipment, testing methods, and machinery, enabling us to stay informed about emerging technologies.\"\n\nMr. Avinash Kumar Talwar, Vice President, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories said, \"Hyderabad is the biggest market for pharmaceuticals, and the city is known as the Pharma hub of India. The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is valued at around $50 Billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% by 2030. The pharmaceutical market in India is expected to reach $65 Billion by 2024, and $130 Billion by 2030. As the growth of Pharma market is coming from complex molecules, it will force them to invest and build future state-of-the art labs. The demand for sophisticated equipments and instruments to aid in the process of drug discovery, development, analysis and modelling of the compounds will continue to grow at the same pace. We should be proud that in total there are 214 US FDA approved facilities in Hyderabad which is impressive and that is another reason why Hyderabad is known as the Pharma hub of India. There are many small laboratories in Hyderabad and other South Indian cities like Chennai and Bengaluru who probably cannot visit the overseas equipment manufacturers and other such great expos. Hence, events like PharmaLytica will help provide them with the opportunity to participate and modernize their labs with technologies that will be displayed during the exhibition. Buyers and sellers can exchange their views and explore business opportunities through this event. Pharma packaging involves all the operations, from productions to drug distribution channels to the end customer. Factors such as rising number of pharmaceutical industries in an emerging economy, and rising demand for drug deliver devices, packaging are the major drivers for the pharma packaging market. The current challenge for the packaging industry is to have sustainable packaging at the optimum price along with new industry trends like ESG, and I am sure events like this would help the industry align better and take it to new heights.\"\n\nShankar Gupta, Chief Sales Officer, ACG said, \"We are proud of India's pharmaceutical industry, which has gained immense recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our country has earned global fame by supplying medicines, including COVID vaccines, not only to our own citizens but also to people worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry in India is experiencing remarkable growth, being the third largest producer by volume and 14th largest by value. However, we strive to further expand our presence and increase the value of our products. Going global is crucial for this endeavor. Events like the one organized by Informa Markets are instrumental in promoting the Indian pharmaceutical industry on an international scale. The tremendous footfall and networking opportunities at this event are a testament to the team's remarkable efforts. We are determined to seize this opportunity and propel ourselves to greater heights\"\n\nPharmaLytica featured a wide array of industry-leading exhibitors showcasing their innovations.

            "title": "Why contract drug manufacturers meet FDA norms easily while others struggle",
            "body": "Contract development and manufacturing organisations undergo several rounds of inspections before they are engaged by client companies to make key drug ingredients.\n\nOver the past year, the US Food and Drug Administration has slapped restrictions on the manufacturing facilities of some Indian generic drug companies that sell medicines in the US for failing to meet good manufacturing practices.\n\nIn almost stark contrast, contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMO), which make key drug ingredients for pharmaceutical client companies after carrying out innovation and development work, hardly fail to meet the FDA's rigorous manufacturing standards.\n\nConsequently, generic drug companies lose revenue because the launch of their new products is delayed until the curbs on their manufacturing facilities are lifted by the US regulator.\n\nIn India, examples of CDMOs include Laurus Labs and Suven Pharmaceuticals. Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries are among the main generic drug manufacturers.\n\nSun Pharma said on April 23 it will temporarily halt production at its Mohali manufacturing unit to implement corrective measures, as guided by the FDA, before it can release further product batches into the US.\n\nAlso Read: Is dual drug filing the right tactic for pharma companies now?\n\nA pharma analyst for a domestic brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that CDMOs undergo several rounds of inspections by their clients before they go ahead with checks from the FDA.\n\nAfter going through so many inspections by their clients, the manufacturing units become well-equipped to clear the FDA's checks, the analyst said.\n\nAlso Read: Delayed drug launches to hurt Cipla's earnings in FY24\n\n\"Drawing a comparison over the inspection results of CDMOs and US generic players is like comparing the results of a student who has taken several mock tests before giving an exam while the other has landed straight to writing the paper,\" the analyst said.\n\nVineet Gala, the founder of Xylem Investment Managers who tracks the pharma sector, said client inspections help but he majorly attributed the relatively easier ride for CDMOs to the lower scrutiny they face because the production process for each drug is different.\n\n\"CDMO players supplying intermediates/APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) generally face lower scrutiny from the US FDA versus what a typical generic formulations player would,\" Gala said. \"As for players doing formulations in CDMO, many have their plants in the US or the European Union, where standards of compliance are higher even for their employees, giving them an edge over generic players.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Paragraph, being one of its kind co-working space in Ahmedabad has been helpful in saving many businesses save a sizable operational cost without compromising on a new-age working environment. Moreover, the strategic location offers greater connectivity and reduces all the logistical hassles,\" adds Harshil Khajanchi.\n\nNot only this, but the co-working space-business centre is also technology-enabled, wherein the members can book conference and meeting rooms on Paragraph's specially developed application that requires minimal human intervention.

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices opened higher on Friday, snapping a 2-day losing streak amid positive global cues, supported by higher possibility of a US rate hike pause.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex rose 184.87 points to 62,613.41 at around 9:40 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 59 points to 18,546.75. All indices in the broader markets were also trading in the green as appetite grew for risky investments.\n\nAll sectoral indices were also trading in the green, with a strong rebound in Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services. Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty were the top gainers as both rose over 1 per cent.\n\nThe top five gainers on the NSE Nifty 50 were Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Britannia. On the other hand, the top losers were HDFC Life, Cipla, Coal India, Eicher Motors, Sun Pharma and HDFC.\n\nDeven Mehata, research analyst at Choice, said, \"The charts indicate that the Nifty may get support at 18,450, followed by 18,400 and 18,350. If the index advances, 18,520 would be the initial key resistance level to watch out for, followed by 18,570 and 18,650.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that the reason for the positive start on Dalal Street is a strong rebound in the US markets. \"\n\n\"The view remains positive as we can witness strong momentum in mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The rally on higher side will continue in the markets and the running corrections will be a buying opportunity. The strong support is placed near 18,300 and hence these levels should be a stop loss on closing basis,\" he said.",

            "title": "Cell Therapy Global Market to Grow Rapidly at a CAGR of ~14% by 2028 | DelveInsight ",
            "body": "New York, USA, June 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cell Therapy Global Market to Grow Rapidly at a CAGR of ~14% by 2028 | DelveInsight\n\nThe global cell therapy market is predicted to showcase positive growth owing to the rising incidence of oncological disorders such as blood cancer and others, the increase in cases of critical limb ischemia (CLI), increasing R&D and investments for cell therapy, and growing advances in technologies used for manipulation and administration of cell therapies by leading companies such as Cipla, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson Services, Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, and others.\n\nDelveInsight's Cell Therapy Market Insights report provides the current and forecast market analysis, individual leading cell therapy companies' market shares, challenges, cell therapy market drivers, barriers, trends, and key market cell therapy companies in the market.\n\nKey Takeaways from the Cell Therapy Market Report\n\nTo read more about the latest highlights related to the cell therapy market, get a snapshot of the key highlights entailed in the Global Cell Therapy Market Report\n\nCell Therapy Overview\n\nCell therapy is a treatment method that involves replacing diseased or malfunctioning cells with healthy functioning ones. Because of their potential to specialize in specific cells required for healing damaged or malfunctioning tissues or cells, stem cells are mostly used for such sophisticated therapies. Furthermore, cell therapy is used in the development of regenerative medicines, which is a multidisciplinary field aimed at the maintenance, improvement, or restoration of cell, tissue, or organ function using cell therapy-related methods. Cells such as blood and bone marrow cells, mature, immature, and solid tissue cells, adult stem cells, and embryonic stem cells are also commonly employed in cell therapy operations. Furthermore, transplanted cells such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are classified as autologous cell therapy and non-autologous cell therapy.\n\nNorth America is expected to account for the highest proportion of the cell therapy market in 2023, out of all regions. The cell therapy market is expected to grow significantly in the region due to the importance of key growth factors such as an increasing patient population suffering from cancer, sophisticated healthcare infrastructure, the presence of key players, and among others. The increasing number of product development activities in the region will push the expansion of the cell therapy market even further. For instance, Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel), a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2022 for the treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL).\n\nTo know more about why North America is leading the market growth in the cell therapy market, get a snapshot of the Cell Therapy Market Outlook\n\nCell Therapy Market Dynamics\n\nCell therapy is increasingly being used to treat blood malignancies. For example, Novartis AG's Kymriah is the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The increase in strategic initiatives on cell therapy is also predicted to fuel the cell therapy market. For example, Century Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb announced a strategic collaboration in October 2022 to develop iPSC-derived allogeneic cell treatments.\n\nSimilarly, AstraZeneca announced an agreement to acquire Neogene Therapeutics Inc. in November 2022, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the discovery, development, and manufacturing of next-generation T-cell receptor therapies (TCR-Ts) that provide a novel cell therapy approach for targeting cancer.\n\nHowever, challenges associated with cell therapy manufacturing and the extremely high treatment cost of cell therapy may limit the overall cell therapy market growth.\n\nAdditionally, the cell therapy market was significantly impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lockdown impositions as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection, which resulted in the suspension of cell therapy research and development activities due to a lack of raw materials and required workforce. Nonetheless, the cell therapy market is in a recovery phase as a result of the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and the resumption of activities in all sectors, including healthcare and pharmaceutical, providing ample opportunities for the cell therapy market to grow at significant revenue during the forecast period.\n\nGet a sneak peek at the cell therapy market dynamics @ Cell Therapy Market Dynamics Analysis\n\nCell Therapy Market Assessment\n\nWhich MedTech key players in the cell therapy market are set to emerge as the trendsetter explore @ Cell Therapy Companies\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInterested in knowing the cell therapy market by 2028?

            "body": "From Mahatma Gandhi's friend Hermann Kallenbach to pharma giant Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied's mother Luba Derczanska, a new comics book gives readers a peek into the life of six Lithuanian personalities and how their travel to India led to the first recorded connection between the two countries.\n\n''First Lithuanian Travelers in India'', published by the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi, is based on two historical books -- ''India & Lithuania: A Personal Bond'' and ''From Lithuania to Santiniketan: Schlomith Flaum & Rabindranath Tagore''.\n\n''The idea for this comic book was coined by the Lithuanian Embassy and the previous ambassador Laimonas and his wife Alina... The biggest enjoyment for me was the variety of the characters, their backgrounds and personalities - I tried to depict this variety with slightly different visual and storytelling styles,'' Migle Anusauskaite, the comics artist for the book, told PTI.\n\nUndeterred by danger and storm, Lithuanian men and women ventured to India by sailboat, train, motorbike -- always driven by great ideas and noble aspirations.\n\nIt include little-known stories of Lithuanians travelling to India, including that of Jesuit priest Andrius Rudamania, the very first Lithuanian to visit India in the early 17th century; educator Schlomith Flaum, who lived and taught in Rabindranath Tagore's Santiniketan for two years; and anthropologist Antanas Poska, who undertook a journey to India on a motor bike all the way from Vilnius in 1929. ''I think the main aim of the project was to show connections - of people, of cultures, of ideas. From the reactions I've seen of the Lithuanian public, people were really amazed, if not proud, of those travelers,'' said Anusauskaite.\n\nAccording to the publishers, the book besides reminding readers of how global and interconnected Lithuania and India had been over the centuries, would also serve as a proof that true friendship and creative ideas can bring faraway countries together.\n\n''When both Lithuania and India were colonized, it's the people who maintained the relationship between our countries. The pull of the Indian civilization in Lithuania was always very strong. Indian philosophy, Gandhian ideas had a great influence on the Lithuanian National revival,'' said Lithuanian Ambassador to India Diana Mickeviciene -- also the author of research for one of the characters of the book.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

            "body": "\"From a commodity perspective, we are positive on two things. One, cement, because the benefit of lower coking coal prices or coal prices will start reflecting from Q2 onwards. Most of your tier I companies have reported very impressive volume growth, so that is one space which we are liking which should benefit from the overall commodity decline,\" says Pankaj Pandey, Head Research, ICICIdirect.com.\n\nWhich side of the equation are you tilting towards? Are you a bull on asset management companies or a bear?\n\nWhen we look at some of these ancillary or subsidiaries companies of banks, so our clear focus is largely towards banks because we have tried insurance companies, we have tried AMCs and also even credit card companies. The growth trajectory is still not very clear and so that is where the challenge lies. So, for example, in case of AMC, while the SIP inflows are good, we would expect earning growth to be in mid-teens and that should help the overall market to do well and eventually leading to better AUM for most of the AMCs.\n\nBut the challenges are still there in terms of regulatory, so which is why if you have to play, banks are a better bet. So, I will play it through HDFC Bank rather than playing it individually through HDFC AMC or HDFC Life. So, if I have to ride that opportunity, banks are offering a slightly better option compared to chasing individual names.Which is one commodity end of the market you are excited about -- sugar, steel, tea?\n\nFrom a commodity perspective, we are positive on two things. One, cement, because the benefit of lower coking coal prices or coal prices will start reflecting from Q2 onwards. Most of your tier I companies have reported very impressive volume growth, so that is one space which we are liking which should benefit from the overall commodity decline.\n\nThe other is the autos because autos in general will benefit from that. Another segment which we like is the tile manufacturers. Volume growth is expected to be 12-13 odd percent. We have seen gas prices correcting and most of these players have yet to witness peak margins.\n\nSo, for example, Kajaria, the peak margin used to be about 20 odd percent. We are still looking at 16% kind of a margin in terms of numbers. Volume growth is good because Morbi players are largely exporting and not really dumping domestically, so price discipline is also better and overall real estate as a segment is also shaping up well. So, this is one space where we like both Kajaria as well as Somany Ceramics.\n\nDivi's, Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin, all of them are pharma but all of them represent different businesses. One is injectable, one is US generic and one is CRAMs. Which end of the pharmaceutical space is looking interesting?\n\nWhen we look at traditional pharma exporters, so while for a company like Aurobindo Pharma, US contributes 46%, the specialty portfolio has done well for them. But even if you take into account all of that, you will see decent top line and bottom line growth. But the ROEs are still subdued at about 10 odd percent so which is why while it trades cheaper 10, 11, 12 times but we are not comfortable in terms of recommending.\n\nWhat we like is more of CRAM or companies like Divi's. So, while the gross margins have declined from 67% to 60%, but our sense is that in the subsequent quarters things are improving, companies are guiding for higher level of inquiries, so things are improving there and which is why Divi's despite it trades at 10 times sales we are comfortable recommending that stock even at current levels.\n\nSo, we are still not chasing US-based specialty exporters or generic exporters, so CRAMs still a lot more better space to be in. What about the other side, I mean, pure domestic companies, let us say Mankind or Cipla which gets a large play from domestic market. Do you like the India focussed pharma names in which ones?\n\nWhat we like is Torrent Pharma because Torrent Pharma trades at nearly about 28-29 times, so a bit expensive, but a\n\ngood portion of the top line is coming from the domestic side, after a long period of time company is guiding for higher EBITDA margins and that will improve the ROCE and also our sense is that possibly could lead to better multiples.\n\nSo, while the stock has run up, but we still feel that this is one of the better stocks to look at on the domestic side because their productivity or various parameters when you look at they have been delivering far more better growth compared to a lot of other domestic oriented names.\n\nWhat is the outlook for IT given the fact that the latest report from Jefferies indicates that there is a lot of caution among clients when it comes to Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra which is what they have highlighted and that is leading to increased scrutiny on discretionary spends. Given the fact that there is a risk of renewals despite the strong deal pipeline, would you be circumspect on the IT space?\n\nValuations are definitely attractive in the tier I space. So, for example, Infosys is trading at 15% below their long-term average while the growth is still expected to be soft at about 6% to 8% odd kind of a constant currency growth, a lot will depend on how things pan out in the US in the subsequent quarter, so it is a good contra play to be looked at.\n\nBut when that upside will come it is very difficult to put a number to it because we are still looking at probability rate hikes in US.\n\nBut I think tier II names, say for example, something like Newgen Software which has got a very balanced revenue profile and is comfortable delivering double-digit growth, it looks better.\n\nSimilarly, when you look at even the other tier II names be it Persistent or be it Coforge, these companies are comfortable guiding for decent double-digit growth, so that is the space we would look at. While we like them, but we do not know by when or how would be the trajectory going forward in terms of price performance.\n\nREAD SOURCE",

            "title": "Contaminated drugs, shredded papers: US FDA uncovers failures in",
            "body": "For years, the FDA has raised flags about standards at Indian factories\n\nUS inspectors have in recent months uncovered wide-ranging lapses at factories run by some of India's biggest pharmaceutical firms, as the world's top supplier of cheap medicine faces increased scrutiny after a spate of deadly manufacturing incidents.\n\nDozens of drugmakers were issued notices and warning letters by the US Food and Drug Administration, which is increasing visits to Indian factories after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions last year. Inspectors detailed unsanitary conditions in manufacturing plants and poorly trained staff; shredded paperwork and under-investigated customer complaints; and evidence of exporting contaminated drugs to the US.\n\nThe expansive lapses -- detailed in FDA records obtained by Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act -- suggest that a nearly two-year hiatus in factory audits during the pandemic meant faults were missed in some Indian plants that export to the US. The South Asian nation is the largest supplier of generic drugs to the US and dozens of other countries. The $50 billion sector is under the spotlight after a number of recent scandals linked to smaller, privately-held Indian companies, including the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan from adulterated cough syrup, and supplying contaminated chemotherapy drugs to the US.\n\nAlso read | India makes cough syrup tests must for exports\n\nThose tragedies have prompted renewed calls by public health campaigners for more rigorous oversight and a rethinking of supply chains across the world. The Biden administration has warned about the preponderance of drug supplies from countries like India, and pushed to produce more medicine domestically. The deaths and drug recalls also come at a critical time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is selling the South Asian nation to investors as an alternative to China for high-quality manufacturing.\n\n\"It's like playing whack-a-mole,\" said Alice Wang, a London-based fund manager at Quaero Capital LLP, which for now has avoided investing in Indian pharma firms. \"India is still behind China in many significant ways and some investments in the high-value-precision manufacturing spaces may end up needing a reality check.\"\n\nThe adverse audits, some details of which are being reported for the first time, have also hit company stocks and scared off some investors from the sector. The S&P BSE Healthcare Index, which tracks India's top industry stocks, has fallen 9.6 per cent since the start of 2022, under-performing the 7.3 per cent gain of the benchmark S&P BSE 100 Index.\n\nMany Indian pharma companies under scrutiny by the FDA said in statements to Bloomberg News that they are addressing the agency's concerns about manufacturing practices. Indian authorities have suspended the licenses of more than a dozen unlisted drugmakers in the wake of the cough syrup deaths, and haven't released public details on the process to have them reinstated. In addition, from June 1 it's compulsory for cough-syrup makers to send samples to a government-approved laboratory and obtain a certificate of analysis before their products can be exported.\n\nMultiple Warnings\n\nFor years, the FDA has raised flags about standards at Indian factories. In 2019, the body told Congress that India -- at 83 per cent -- had the lowest percentage of acceptable inspection outcomes at drug manufacturing facilities across the countries it policed. China had the second lowest percentage at 90 per cent, followed by the US at 93 per cent, with the European Union coming in at 98 per cent. The report didn't provide a more comprehensive breakdown.\n\nSince the start of 2022, Indian drugmakers were issued nine FDA warning letters, which may lead to a ban of new products into the US. India is tied with Mexico for the most such letters for any overseas nation in that period, according to analysis of the agency's data. Dozens of Indian pharma firms were also served Form 483s, which list potential violations.\n\nIn recent months, the pace of disclosures about lapses has picked up. In February, unlisted Chennai-based Global Pharma Healthcare Pvt Ltd. recalled eye drops and ointment exported to the US. This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked the products to 81 drug-resistant bacterial infections, four deaths and 14 cases of vision loss. Four people also had to have their eyeballs surgically removed because of the drops, according to the CDC.\n\nDuring an FDA review of the firm's plant in southern India, inspectors found sterility problems and quality failures in areas where the ointment was being produced. Global Pharma Healthcare didn't respond to a request for comment. In the recall notice, the company ordered retailers and customers to stop selling and using the drops and ointment, citing reports of eye infections, blindness and a death.\n\nWhile many of the recent medicine scandals have been traced to small producers that don't export to highly-regulated European and North American markets, FDA reports and recalls reviewed by Bloomberg News suggest problems also reach the top of India's drug-making sector.\n\nDinesh Thakur, the co-author of 'The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India' and a former pharma executive, said it's difficult to \"name one large Indian generics manufacturer that hasn't been cited\" by the FDA in recent years.\n\n\"One only needs to look at the 483 and warning letters,\" said Thakur, who helped expose issues at Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., which pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2013 for making and distributing adulterated drugs bound for the US.\n\nAt a factory run by Lupin Ltd., one of India's top five listed drugmakers by market value, FDA inspectors in March said in a report obtained by Bloomberg News through a FOIA request that the site's staff only investigated 48 breakdown notifications out of 1,759 between January 2019 and March 2023. The facility is in Pithampur, in central India.\n\n\"We have taken swift action to comprehensively address all observations and are taking comprehensive measures to ensure compliance with all regulations,\" a Lupin spokesperson said. The company is \"committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and compliance in all our manufacturing processes.\"\n\nDocument Shredding\n\nCipla Ltd, a storied Mumbai-based drugmaker that pioneered the sale of cheap HIV drugs across Africa, received more than 3,000 US patient complaints since 2020 for an unidentified product made at its factory in central India, the FDA found. But the agency's inspectors only discovered the complaints in February when they visited the facility, according to an audit released under FOIA and reviewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nNine out of 10 of those were related to the product's performance, the inspectors wrote, adding that staff failed to implement \"effective corrective actions\" to reduce complaints.\n\nThe same Cipla plant was also cited for failing to retain original records. Inspectors observed a truck loaded with bags of scrap and documents marked for shredding. In February, the company's shares fell the most in nearly two years after Cipla notified Indian stock exchanges about eight potential violations flagged by the FDA.\n\n\"We have examined all data pertaining to our drug performance and have determined that the products in the market are safe and efficacious for use,\" a Cipla spokesperson said. \"In addition, following the audit we have further strengthened our processes and controls to better handle complaints and are working closely with the regulatory authorities on our recommended corrective and preventive actions.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that none of the \"scrap documents\" were so-called \"good manufacturing practice\" records or contained sensitive information -- and that an independent party is reviewing Cipla's \"documentation practices.\" The FDA inspection record doesn't clarify whether agency personnel halted shredding or simply observed the documents.\n\n'Significant' Violations\n\nOne of the most impacted firms has been Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. -- the country's largest drugmaker by revenue. In December, the FDA wrote to billionaire owner Dilip Shanghvi to summarize \"significant\" violations at Sun's plant in Halol, in western India, where capsule samples failed to meet dissolution specifications. The agency placed the factory under an import alert, meaning US-destined products may be detained without inspection and are subject to heightened scrutiny.\n\nThat came after auditors discovered water leaks and equipment used to manufacture drugs that weren't adequately cleaned and maintained, according to the letter. One staff member running visual quality checks since 2014 had repeatedly failed to identify defects, according to an earlier audit report reviewed by Bloomberg News. After the inspection, Sun Pharma later recalled batches of injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate, a hormonal birth control, as well as testosterone cypionate injections.\n\nSun Pharma said US supplies from the Halol site accounted for about 3 per cent of consolidated revenue in the year through March 2022 and 14 of their products were excluded from the import alert, subject to certain conditions. Last year, the company said it's \"committed\" to compliance. On a call with industry analysts at the end of January, Shanghvi said the Halol plant continues to export to other countries.\n\nBut in April, Sun Pharma notified India's stock exchanges that the FDA had asked for \"corrective actions\" in another one of its plants before exporting products to the US -- this one in Mohali, in northern India. The firm's shares fell the most in four months after the disclosure.\n\nIn a letter from the FDA to Sun Pharma, which Bloomberg News obtained through a FOIA request, the US agency listed three \"significant\" violations at the Mohali factory. The issues highlighted were \"inadequate\" investigations into unexplained drug discrepancies; a failure to document or justify deviations from laboratory control mechanisms; and the manufacturing of a drug for chronic angina through 2021 to 2022 \"despite failing dissolution results.\"\n\nSun Pharma notified the stock exchanges that it would hire independent manufacturing auditors and temporarily halt shipments to the US. The FDA letter also gives additional information about the timeline: Sun Pharma must seek the agency's sign-off on drug batches the company plans to export for at least 12 months.\n\n\"We are taking all necessary steps to resolve the outstanding issues as fast as possible,\" said a Sun Pharma spokesperson.\n\nBeyond safety, the problems could also come with a cost to India's drug manufacturers and disrupt supplies in the US. Analysts from Nomura Holdings Inc. estimate the affected Mohali factory alone contributes $100 million to $150 million in annual sales to Sun Pharma's US business.\n\nAs US inspectors work through a pandemic-era backlog of more than 1,000 foreign drug-plant audits across the world, the latest problems are unlikely to mark India's last. Overseas inspections were down 74 per cent last year from 1,204 reviews in 2019. Only 245 such visits have taken place so far this year.\n\nTushar Manudhane, a pharma analyst at Mumbai-brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., said the \"pace of inspections is still much lower than it was pre-Covid.\" As they ramp up, he said, the risk of more adverse FDA findings \"will continue to rise.\"",

            "body": "(Bloomberg) -- US inspectors have in recent months uncovered wide-ranging lapses at factories run by some of India's biggest pharmaceutical firms, as the world's top supplier of cheap medicine faces increased scrutiny after a spate of deadly manufacturing incidents.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDozens of drugmakers were issued notices and warning letters by the US Food and Drug Administration, which is increasing visits to Indian factories after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions last year. Inspectors detailed unsanitary conditions in manufacturing plants and poorly trained staff; shredded paperwork and under-investigated customer complaints; and evidence of exporting contaminated drugs to the US.\n\nThe expansive lapses -- detailed in FDA records obtained by Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act -- suggest that a nearly two-year hiatus in factory audits during the pandemic meant faults were missed in some Indian plants that export to the US. The South Asian nation is the largest supplier of generic drugs to the US and dozens of other countries. The $50 billion sector is under the spotlight after a number of recent scandals linked to smaller, privately-held Indian companies, including the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan from adulterated cough syrup, and supplying contaminated chemotherapy drugs to the US.\n\nRead: Cough Syrup Linked to 20 Kids' Deaths Was Circulating for Months\n\nThose tragedies have prompted renewed calls by public health campaigners for more rigorous oversight and a rethinking of supply chains across the world. The Biden administration has warned about the preponderance of drug supplies from countries like India, and pushed to produce more medicine domestically. The deaths and drug recalls also come at a critical time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is selling the South Asian nation to investors as an alternative to China for high-quality manufacturing.\n\n\"It's like playing whack-a-mole,\" said Alice Wang, a London-based fund manager at Quaero Capital LLP, which for now has avoided investing in Indian pharma firms. \"India is still behind China in many significant ways and some investments in the high-value-precision manufacturing spaces may end up needing a reality check.\"\n\nThe adverse audits, some details of which are being reported for the first time, have also hit company stocks and scared off some investors from the sector. The S&P BSE Healthcare Index, which tracks India's top industry stocks, has fallen 9.6% since the start of 2022, under-performing the 7.3% gain of the benchmark S&P BSE 100 Index.\n\nMany Indian pharma companies under scrutiny by the FDA said in statements to Bloomberg News that they are addressing the agency's concerns about manufacturing practices. Indian authorities have suspended the licenses of more than a dozen unlisted drugmakers in the wake of the cough syrup deaths, and haven't released public details on the process to have them reinstated. In addition, from June 1 it's compulsory for cough-syrup makers to send samples to a government-approved laboratory and obtain a certificate of analysis before their products can be exported.\n\nMultiple Warnings\n\nFor years, the FDA has raised flags about standards at Indian factories. In 2019, the body told Congress that India -- at 83% -- had the lowest percentage of acceptable inspection outcomes at drug manufacturing facilities across the countries it policed. China had the second lowest percentage at 90%, followed by the US at 93%, with the European Union coming in at 98%. The report didn't provide a more comprehensive breakdown.\n\nSince the start of 2022, Indian drugmakers were issued nine FDA warning letters, which may lead to a ban of new products into the US. India is tied with Mexico for the most such letters for any overseas nation in that period, according to analysis of the agency's data. Dozens of Indian pharma firms were also served Form 483s, which list potential violations.\n\nIn recent months, the pace of disclosures about lapses has picked up. In February, unlisted Chennai-based Global Pharma Healthcare Pvt Ltd. recalled eye drops and ointment exported to the US. This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked the products to 81 drug-resistant bacterial infections, four deaths and 14 cases of vision loss. Four people also had to have their eyeballs surgically removed because of the drops, according to the CDC.\n\nDuring an FDA review of the firm's plant in southern India, inspectors found sterility problems and quality failures in areas where the ointment was being produced. Global Pharma Healthcare didn't respond to a request for comment. In the recall notice, the company ordered retailers and customers to stop selling and using the drops and ointment, citing reports of eye infections, blindness and a death.\n\nRead: Clusters of Eye Drop-Linked Infections Found in Four States\n\nWhile many of the recent medicine scandals have been traced to small producers that don't export to highly-regulated European and North American markets, FDA reports and recalls reviewed by Bloomberg News suggest problems also reach the top of India's drug-making sector.\n\nDinesh Thakur, the co-author of The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India and a former pharma executive, said it's difficult to \"name one large Indian generics manufacturer that hasn't been cited\" by the FDA in recent years.\n\n\"One only needs to look at the 483 and warning letters,\" said Thakur, who helped expose issues at Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., which pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2013 for making and distributing adulterated drugs bound for the US.\n\nAt a factory run by Lupin Ltd., one of India's top five listed drugmakers by market value, FDA inspectors in March said in a report obtained by Bloomberg News through a FOIA request that the site's staff only investigated 48 breakdown notifications out of 1,759 between January 2019 and March 2023. The facility is in Pithampur, in central India.\n\n\"We have taken swift action to comprehensively address all observations and are taking comprehensive measures to ensure compliance with all regulations,\" a Lupin spokesperson said. The company is \"committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and compliance in all our manufacturing processes.\"\n\nDocument Shredding\n\nCipla Ltd., a storied Mumbai-based drugmaker that pioneered the sale of cheap HIV drugs across Africa, received more than 3,000 US patient complaints since 2020 for an unidentified product made at its factory in central India, the FDA found. But the agency's inspectors only discovered the complaints in February when they visited the facility, according to an audit released under FOIA and reviewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nNine out of 10 of those were related to the product's performance, the inspectors wrote, adding that staff failed to implement \"effective corrective actions\" to reduce complaints.\n\nThe same Cipla plant was also cited for failing to retain original records. Inspectors observed a truck loaded with bags of scrap and documents marked for shredding. In February, the company's shares fell the most in nearly two years after Cipla notified Indian stock exchanges about eight potential violations flagged by the FDA.\n\n\"We have examined all data pertaining to our drug performance and have determined that the products in the market are safe and efficacious for use,\" a Cipla spokesperson said. \"In addition, following the audit we have further strengthened our processes and controls to better handle complaints and are working closely with the regulatory authorities on our recommended corrective and preventive actions.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that none of the \"scrap documents\" were so-called \"good manufacturing practice\" records or contained sensitive information -- and that an independent party is reviewing Cipla's \"documentation practices.\" The FDA inspection record doesn't clarify whether agency personnel halted shredding or simply observed the documents.\n\nRead: Just How Dangerous Are India's Generic Drugs? Very: Ruth Pollard\n\n'Significant' Violations\n\nOne of the most impacted firms has been Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. -- the country's largest drugmaker by revenue. In December, the FDA wrote to billionaire owner Dilip Shanghvi to summarize \"significant\" violations at Sun's plant in Halol, in western India, where capsule samples failed to meet dissolution specifications. The agency placed the factory under an import alert, meaning US-destined products may be detained without inspection and are subject to heightened scrutiny.\n\nThat came after auditors discovered water leaks and equipment used to manufacture drugs that weren't adequately cleaned and maintained, according to the letter. One staff member running visual quality checks since 2014 had repeatedly failed to identify defects, according to an earlier audit report reviewed by Bloomberg News. After the inspection, Sun Pharma later recalled batches of injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate, a hormonal birth control, as well as testosterone cypionate injections.\n\nSun Pharma said US supplies from the Halol site accounted for about 3% of consolidated revenue in the year through March 2022 and 14 of their products were excluded from the import alert, subject to certain conditions. Last year, the company said it's \"committed\" to compliance. On a call with industry analysts at the end of January, Shanghvi said the Halol plant continues to export to other countries.\n\nBut in April, Sun Pharma notified India's stock exchanges that the FDA had asked for \"corrective actions\" in another one of its plants before exporting products to the US -- this one in Mohali, in northern India. The firm's shares fell the most in four months after the disclosure.\n\nIn a letter from the FDA to Sun Pharma, which Bloomberg News obtained through a FOIA request, the US agency listed three \"significant\" violations at the Mohali factory. The issues highlighted were \"inadequate\" investigations into unexplained drug discrepancies; a failure to document or justify deviations from laboratory control mechanisms; and the manufacturing of a drug for chronic angina through 2021 to 2022 \"despite failing dissolution results.\"\n\nSun Pharma notified the stock exchanges that it would hire independent manufacturing auditors and temporarily halt shipments to the US. The FDA letter also gives additional information about the timeline: Sun Pharma must seek the agency's sign-off on drug batches the company plans to export for at least 12 months.\n\n\"We are taking all necessary steps to resolve the outstanding issues as fast as possible,\" said a Sun Pharma spokesperson.\n\nBeyond safety, the problems could also come with a cost to India's drug manufacturers and disrupt supplies in the US. Analysts from Nomura Holdings Inc. estimate the affected Mohali factory alone contributes $100 million to $150 million in annual sales to Sun Pharma's US business.\n\nAs US inspectors work through a pandemic-era backlog of more than 1,000 foreign drug-plant audits across the world, the latest problems are unlikely to mark India's last. Overseas inspections were down 74% last year from 1,204 reviews in 2019. Only 245 such visits have taken place so far this year.\n\nTushar Manudhane, a pharma analyst at Mumbai-brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., said the \"pace of inspections is still much lower than it was pre-Covid.\" As they ramp up, he said, the risk of more adverse FDA findings \"will continue to rise.\"",

            "body": "The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)-Eastern Eye \"Garden of Unity\", designed by Manoj Malde, appears to have been one of the big hits of the Chelsea Flower Show this year.\n\nLocated prominently on Main Avenue and close to the Great Pavilion, Malde's vivid colours attracted even King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n\nAnother visitor, Thérèse Coffey, secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, spoke to Malde about how to achieve greater diversity in the world of gardening - she is set to attend the G20 summit in India in September alongside prime minister Rishi Sunak.\n\n\"Gardening is for everyone,\" said Clare Matterson, setting out her long-term strategy as director general of the RHS, which is also working closely with the Department of Education to take gardening to schools across the country.\n\nIf this year is anything to go by, Eastern Eye readers ought to consider becoming members of the Royal Horticultural Society and set a date for the 2024 Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nThe Garden of Unity will see a new life at a school in Battersea (incidentally, membership is only £10 a year for students).\n\nAt Chelsea last week, the RHS and Eastern Eye held a reception\n\nin the Garden of Unity. Matterson came to the event where her senior team was represented by Helena Pettit, director of gardens and shows; Ed Horne, head of communications; and Hayley Monckton, director of communications, who was generous in thanking\n\nEastern Eye.\n\n\"We absolutely love working with you,\" Monckton said. \"I think this garden epitomises our relationship. It is beautiful. It is uplifting, it is accessible and joyful.\"\n\nShe confirmed the garden \"will be living on afterwards. It will be going to a school in Battersea and will bring so much more joy and happiness to life, which I hope will be similar with our partnership that we continue.\"\n\nThe guests included the Indian high commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, who spoke of \"the importance of working with your hands, (and) with the soil.\n\n\"I think Mahatma Gandhi put it really well when he said to forget how to take the earth and turn the soil is to forget ourselves. And so the human connection with the garden and with the soil is such an integral thing - it is part of so many cultures, but, of course, the British culture, and also the history of India, the history of Persia.\n\n\"It is also part of the story of civilisation,\" he went on. \"Because what else is civilisation unless it is all about gardening and about growing plants and about cultivating food? Societies were considered civilised through the move from the pastoral phase to the agricultural phase - and agriculture is, shall we say, the close cousin of gardening. And so gardening is, in many senses, the highlight of human creativity in exploring what nature actually intends.\"\n\nDoraiswami, who is knowledgeable about PG Wodehouse's novels, referred humorously to a couple of his characters: \"You may also remember gardening is central to the Wodehousian universe. Lord Emsworth's greatest quarrels with his gardener Angus McAllister .... (are) about whether to lay moss instead of gravel in the gardens of Lord Emsworth's (Blandings) Castle in Shropshire.\n\n\"And it isn't until you actually reach the UK, you realise why gardening is such a big deal because it is in gardening that I think the British soul, which is otherwise reticent and careful about not expressing itself, really gives itself up into an excess of emotion.\n\n\"I think that, for me, is the beauty of gardens. And that for me is why gardens are sources of unity, because with gardens, you can express yourself in a variety of colours, in a variety of languages, and yet maintain a stiff upper lip.\n\n\"So to gardens, to the RHS and, of course, to our gracious hosts, what better place to meet and celebrate the flower festival than at the Garden of Unity.\"\n\nThe high commissioner made special mention among the guests of Dr Yusuf Hamied, the chairman of Cipla, the Indian pharma giant - \"a legend in his time\" who had saved \"millions of lives\" - and Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP for Brent North and \"a good friend of the India-UK relationship\".\n\nHamied said his wife Farida made sure he didn't miss the reception, while Gardiner, who had come with his poet wife, Caroline Smith, said: \"Gardening helps us realise we are a part of, not apart from, nature. How lovely then to have a Unity Garden at Chelsea this year, with chilli peppers and gourds mingling with plants more commonly seen in an English garden like Ascanthus Mollis and Salvia Verticillata. For centuries gardeners in every country have brought species from 'exotic' places to enhance their native plants and beautify their homes - true examples of unity in diversity.\"\n\nDame Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, otherwise the high court judge, Mrs Justice Cheema Grubb, who had come with her husband Russell, remarked: \"Gardening is a pleasure enjoyed by many people across the world, and the Eastern Eye garden's focus on unity echoes this. Incorporating vibrant planting, the colours of the Indian landscape and some whimsical elements such as the hanging decorations made of bangles, flowers and even real chillies, it was a delight to be invited to see this imaginative garden.\"\n\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, who had to deal with the Covid pandemic as chair of the Council of the British Medical Association (BMA) from 2017-2022, had come with his wife, Meena, who is also a GP.\n\n\"The RHS/Eastern Eye Garden of Unity symbolised to us that the love of flowers and gardens is universal among people of all nations, backgrounds, characteristics - transcending boundaries and is inherently unifying,\" he said. \"The garden exuded inclusivity with pillars inscribed in Braille, and touchingly exhibited how gardens can be a personal expression of cultural heritage and roots - from memorabilia of photos of Manoj's parents to relics from India and Africa where he was born.\"\n\nHis wife added: \"It felt a sanctuary and haven, with a sense of peace enshrined in Indian culture and spirituality.\"\n\nThe Eastern Eye team was led by Kalpesh Solanki and his brother Shailesh, managing editor and executive editor, respectively, of the Asian Media Group (AMG), which had been founded by their late father, Ramniklal Solanki Nagpaul referred to the brothers' late mother, Parvatiben Solanki, the group's co-founder, who had been \"a passionate and avid gardener, regularly attending the RHS shows\".\n\nGuests heard Parvatiben loved growing Princess Lilies, roses and dahlias, as well as chillies, aubergines and colocasia (used to make savoury Gujarati dish called patra) at her home in London. Meanwhile, at her Indian home in Ahmedabad in Gujarat, she grew bougainvillea, jasmine and rajani gandha (fragrant white flowers called tuberose in English).\n\nParvatiben would visit Chelsea, accompanied by her grandson, Jaimin, and snap up bargains at the end of the flower show. That practice remains one of the rituals at Chelsea.\n\nMalde had to answer so many questions at the garden that his voice gave out and he was too un\n\nwell to attend the reception. Among questions he was asked were - where did the inspiration come from for the garden? How were the garlands made? 'Where can I get old oil drums as I would like to paint some for my garden?'\n\n\"There were many questions about the plants, especially the Angelica archangelica and the Grevillea,\" said Malde. \"Many people also asked about the significance of the family photos on the table and the variety of fruits, vegetables and spices that were curated on the table along with exotic flora.\"\n\nHe quickly discovered TV and social media coverage of the garden had gone global. \"Catching the number 170 bus from Victoria to the show grounds, it was surreal that I was recognised by all the passengers,\" he laughed.\n\n\"The public's reaction has been wonderful. They have loved the use of colour and found the garden very joyful. Many remarked it's the only one at the show with so much colour. They seem to really enjoy a designer from a different cultural background bringing his heritage and identity into the garden.\"\n\nAt the end of the Chelsea Flower Show, Shailesh said gardening promotes mental well-being. He summed up: \"We are proud to work with the RHS to engage so many diverse communities. Gardening is truly for everyone.\"",

The reshuffling exercise is scheduled for May 31. As part of the reshuffling exercise, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Indus Towers will be removed from the MSCI Global Standard Index, while Max Healthcare Institute, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Sona BLW Precision Forgings will be included, as mentioned in the Nuvama report. The removal of Adani companies from the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to lead to outflows of $189 million for Adani Transmission and $167 million for Adani Total Gas. The Nuvama report explains that if Adani Total Gas or Adani Transmission trades at the lower price limit for a cumulative duration of at least 5 minutes on the given day, MSCI will delete these securities at the lowest system price as of the close of May 31, 2023. Otherwise, MSCI will use the official closing prices, following the MSCI Index Calculation methodology. According to Nuvama, the inclusion of Max Healthcare in the MSCI Global Standard Index is projected to result in inflows of $312 million and the addition of 47 million shares. Max Healthcare will carry a weight of 0.52 in the index. Additionally, the inclusion of HAL and Sona BLW is expected to bring inflows of $196 million and $171 million, respectively, with HAL carrying a weight of 0.33 and Sona BLW having a weight of 0.29 in the index. In terms of weight adjustments, 16 stocks are expected to see an increase, while 21 stocks will experience a reduction within the MSCI Global Standard Index. Several other stocks are predicted to have increased weights in the MSCI Global Standard Index. These include Maruti Suzuki India, Zomato, Interglobe Aviation, Samvardhana Motherson International, Cipla, Yes Bank, Bandhan Bank, and NTPC, among others.

            "body": "The impact of this persistent pricing erosion was felt in the US revenues of companies like Alkem Laboratories, Gland Pharma, and Biocon, among others.\n\nA plethora of pharmaceutical companies have detailed their fourth-quarter earnings reports in the past two weeks. While hits and misses are a part of the earnings game, brokerage firm Nomura caught some common trends emerging from the earnings showdown.\n\nThe most visible trend within the pharma sector earnings was the persistent price pressure in the US generics market. The last quarter was filled with reports and management commentaries hinting towards a recovery in the US generics space, pegged on signs of easing price erosion.\n\nWhile there has been some moderation in the intensity of price erosion, Nomura highlighted that the US generics pricing environment still remains challenging.\n\nThe impact of this persistent pricing erosion was felt in the US revenues of companies like Alkem Laboratories, Gland Pharma, and Biocon, among others.\n\nA similar story is seen emerging from the input cost front. \"Cost pressures remain for pharma companies, as the prices of certain raw materials are still elevated,\" Nomura stated in its report.\n\nIn an attempt to recover numbers from the loss of COVID sales, pharma companies are also pushing their sales and marketing costs higher. Companies are also stepping up investments in research and development (R&D) initiatives as noted by Nomura, in an attempt to grab a higher market share.\n\nIndustry major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries also guided higher R&D investments towards the specialty and US generic business, going up to 7-8 percent of sales in FY24.\n\nAnalyzing the earnings report card of companies that have recently released their quarterly numbers, Nomura listed Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Zydus Lifesciences as their biggest hits this season. The firm has a 'buy' call for the three pharma companies.\n\nWhen it comes to the laggards, Nomura stated that Alkem Labs, Gland Pharma, Divi's Laboratories, Abbott India, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, and JB Pharma reported numbers below its forecasts or consensus estimates.\n\nFocusing on hospital companies, the brokerage firm highlighted a consistent increase in Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed (ARPOB) and improvement in case and payer mix.\n\nThe broking firm also remains positive on the outlook given by hospital majors that indicate constructive growth and better EBITDA margin performance in FY24.\n\nWithin the hospital space, Max Healthcare posted quarterly earnings that were ahead of estimates while Fortis Healthcare lagged expectations.\n\nNomura sees a gradual improvement in the hospital business performance aided by higher ARPOB and better case and payer mix as a positive for Fortis. Regardless, the broking firm also pointed towards the company's underperformance as against its peers.",

In 2013, Forbes listed Saad as one of the world's richest people, with a net worth of $1 billion. His fortune peaked at $2.1 billion in 2015, but a string of missteps such as allegations of anticompetitive conduct, among other things, have sent Aspen's stock price wobbling over the years. Saad's 12.8-percent stake in Aspen is now worth over $ 570 million.\n\nHowever, Saad remains the richest African to have built a fortune in the pharma sector.\n\nBillionaires.Africa took stock and came up with the names of seven African entrepreneurs who have founded pharmaceutical companies worth at least $50 million or more and still own significant shares in their companies.\n\nHere are seven multimillionaires in Africa's pharma sector that you should know.\n\nStephen Saad\n\nCitizenship: South Africa\n\nStephen Saad, 58, founded Aspen Pharmacare, South Africa's largest pharmaceuticals maker.\n\nThe company traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and manufactures and markets generic medicines in 150 countries.\n\nSaad is the CEO and head of Aspen's board.\n\nHe and Aspen co-founder Gus Attridge got their first taste in dealmaking in 1999 by purchasing a chain of South African pharmacies before spreading quickly from the coastal city of Durban to international markets.\n\nThe company began producing Africa's first generic antiretroviral drug for HIV in 2003; expansion into infant formula came the following year.

            "body": "Nifty is close to reaching its all-time high due to foreign institutional investors' strong inflows; however, at least seven Nifty50 constituents must rally over 20% to reclaim their previous 52-week highs, including Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports. Gautam Adani's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, must surge 65% to touch its 52-week high of Rs 4,190. Similarly, Infosys, Cipla, and Hindalco are among the stocks that must rise between 21-27% to reclaim their all-time high levels. On the other hand, Bajaj Finserv is languishing 28% away from its 52-week high level of Rs 1,844.Calls on Dalal Street about Nifty reaching its all-time high soon are getting louder. Driven by solid inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), Nifty is flirting with all-time high levels. The benchmark index is just 1.5% shy of reaching its all-time high of 18,887.60 it touched in December last year.\n\nNew-found mojo on the back of the US reaching a debt ceiling agreement could provide a fresh catalyst for bulls to drive the Nifty higher.\n\n\"Indian markets are seeing strong momentum driven by banking and other heavyweight stocks. We expect the uptrend in Nifty to continue and expect it to head toward its life-high levels on the back of positive global cues, consistent FIIs buying, and healthy corporate earnings,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\n\nThat said, the picture is not the same for most index stocks. An analysis by ETMarkets.com shows that at least seven Nifty50 constituents must rally over 20% to reclaim their previous 52-week highs.\n\nHit by the Hindenburg crisis, Gautam Adani's flagship firm Adani Enterprises is the farthest away from its record high levels, followed by Adani Ports.\n\nThe former must surge 65% to touch its 52-week high of Rs 4,190 it hit on December 21. Adani Enterprises in the recently-concluded March quarter reported an over 2-fold year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 722.48 crore. Revenue from operations increased by 26% YoY to Rs 31,346.05 crore.\n\nThe stock has only one hold rating and is currently under short-term additional surveillance by stock exchanges.\n\nAdani Ports, which is slated to post its Q4 earnings on Tuesday, is 36% away from the 52-week high of Rs 987.85. The average analyst estimate for the stock is Rs 834 which suggests an upside of 13% from current levels.\n\nBajaj Finserv is languishing 28% away from the 52-week high level of Rs 1,844 which it touched on September 13, 2022. Analysts, on average, expect it to rise 8% to Rs 1,570.\n\nThe company last month reported a 31% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,769 crore in Q4FY23 as compared to the previous year's profit of Rs 1,346 crore. Its total income during the quarter rose 25% to Rs 23,625 crore as compared to Rs 18,862 crore a year ago.\n\nIT major Infosys, pharma stock Cipla and metal company Hindalco are among other stocks that must rise between 21-27% to reclaim their all-time high levels.\n\n(Data Inputs: Ritesh Presswala)\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "body": "The domestic benchmark indices -- the S&P BSE Sensex and the National Stock Exchange Nifty50 -- had lost close to 1.5 per cent in three days recently before gaining slightly.\n\nIllustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com\n\nNotwithstanding weakness and volatility, the Nifty50 has managed to hold on to the 18,000 mark, while the Sensex has managed to stay above the 61,000 level.\n\nThe performance of the stocks that comprise these front-line indices remains polarised.\n\nThe 20 stocks that comprise the Nifty50 index appear weak, according to their technical chart patterns.\n\nSixteen of these stocks, which include Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, and Cipla, have breached their respective 200-day moving averages (DMA) on the downside.\n\nFor long-term investors, the simple 200-DMA provides a broad outlook on the market or stock trend. Investors and traders prefer stocks holding above their respective 200-DMA as they tend to perform better in a trending market.\n\nRisk management, hence, becomes comparatively easier.\n\nAlternatively, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Larsen & Toubro, Titan Company, and Grasim Industries appear weak as their relative strength indicator (RSI) has slipped below 50.\n\nThe RSI typically oscillates between zero and 100.\n\nA stock or index is considered overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.\n\nThe contribution from the information technology sector to the markets recently has been nothing to write home about.\n\nInfosys, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services have been rangebound with a negative bias.\n\nShares of Adani Group stocks, such as Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, too, remain volatile and will continue to be so until they move past their key resistance levels.\n\nAnalysts believe the market is likely to remain choppy in the near term, and bears may have the upper hand. The 6 per cent rally in the Nifty from March lows, observes V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, has been used as a profit-booking opportunity by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and traders.\n\nThis trend, he believes, is evident from the 'buy the rumour, sell the news' in major stocks like State Bank of India (SBI) and ITC in spite of good 2022-23 (FY23) January-March quarter (fourth quarter, or Q4) results.\n\n\"The Nifty is finding it difficult to break the 18,100-18,400 range despite favourable global cues and good Q4FY23 results.\n\n\"The US 10-year bond yield has risen to 3.64, and the rupee has weakened to 82.65 to the dollar.\n\n\"This currency movement is not supportive of the equity market. Foreign institutional investor buying is being neutralised by DII selling.\n\n\"The 'sell on rally' strategy of bears has worked well this week.\n\n\"The near-term outlook remains cloudy,\" says Vijayakumar.\n\nThe Nifty has until now found some support from select fast-moving consumer goods stocks such as ITC, Britannia Industries, and Nestlé India in the past few weeks.\n\nThese counters have formed 'higher highs and higher lows' in line with their technical chart pattern and are still in bullish mode from a medium-to-long-term perspective.\n\nAmong banking majors, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and SBI appear on track to hit new all-time highs in the weeks ahead, the charts indicate.\n\nTechnical analysts suggest that the markets could find some support at lower levels and that the current weakness will eventually get bought into.\n\n\"If global markets support us, we may see this decline getting bought into, and this time there may be a genuine attempt to retest the higher levels of 18,240-18,300 on the Nifty.\n\n\"On the flip side, 18,100 followed by 18,050 can be considered a strong support zone for the index,\" says Sameet Chavan, head-research, technicals, and derivatives, Angel One.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is meant for information purposes only.

            "body": "Within five years, adolescent girls and women across Africa could be empowered with long-acting anti-HIV injections, virtually eliminating their risk of HIV transmission through sex.\n\nThis, thanks to ViiV Healthcare, together with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), which has signed sub-licence agreements with Aurobindo, Cipla and Viatris (through its subsidiary Mylan).\n\nThe agreement will enable these manufacturers to produce generic versions of cabotegravir long-acting (Cab-La) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and includes potential for large-scale manufacturing on the continent of Africa.\n\nThe accord was formed after ViiV Healthcare and MPP signed a voluntary license agreement in July 2022 for patents related to Cab-La for PrEP. This follows the world's first regulatory approval of Cab-La for PrEP by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just seven months earlier.\n\nNinety countries stand to benefit from the deal, subject to their required regulatory approvals being obtained. To this end, Aurobindo and Viatris will manufacture Cab-La in India while Cipla will be manufacturing Cab-La in either Durban or Benoni in South Africa.\n\nKimberly Smith, ViiV Healthcare's head of research and development, explained last year that the process of making a generic version of a branded medicine requires tech transfer for pharmaceutical companies to understand the manufacturing process. Regarding the timeline for availability, she stated, \"Having generics ready to sell will therefore not be immediate, but could take three to five years from the time that a license has been granted until the product is market-ready.\"\n\nCurrently the Cab-La injection is undergoing clinical trials at the Emavundleni Prevention Research Centre run by the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town.\n\nIt is part of HPTN 084 - a study being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the injectable Cab-La compared to the most commonly used oral PrEP options for HIV prevention worldwide: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), taken orally as a single tablet once daily by HIV-uninfected women.\n\nCab-La is an antiretroviral medication that works differently from a vaccine. Instead of using weakened or inactivated forms of the virus, it contains cabotegravir, which prevents the integration of HIV's DNA into host cells, stopping the virus from replicating.\n\nTaken every two months, Cab-La is intended to be used by HIV-negative individuals who are at high risk of acquiring HIV.\n\nWhile oral PrEP options are now available in many countries, access to Cab-La for PrEP could significantly contribute to reducing HIV transmission by providing people a choice in their HIV-prevention options.\n\nWaterhouse, in reference to ViiV Healthcare's signing of sub-license agreements with its three generic partners, emphasised the potential impact of Cab-La for PrEP on the trajectory of HIV.\n\nShe stated, \"The signing of these sub-license agreements is an incredibly important milestone towards enabling broad access to this medicine in countries where there is the highest burden of new HIV cases. We are committed to working together with MPP and the selected generic manufacturers at pace to help enable development, manufacturing, and supply.\"\n\nAccording to UNAids' latest estimates, the global acquisition of HIV in 2021 reached approximately 1.5 million people, with 860,000 of those cases occurring on the African continent. The burden is particularly heavy on women and adolescent girls, who are disproportionately impacted.",

            "body": "There are still a lot of moving parts. So I think from a domestic economy standpoint, we are well placed. However, from a global standpoint there are still, as you rightly said, there are a lot of moving parts.\n\n\"Globally, the developed markets have not seen higher interest rates and they are still grappling with it and we do not know how that is going to shape up,\" says Rushabh Sheth, Co-CIO, Karma Capital.\n\nIt is an all-time high on the Bank Nifty and Nifty is 400 points away from an all-time high. The tide has turned in favour of Indian equities. Do you think this turn is going to be a long one and we are in for more gains before the year ends?\n\nIf you look at the economy, I think we have kind of managed the higher interest rates reasonably well. I think the inflation seems to be peaking out and hopefully the interest rates also should follow suit. So our sense is that from a standpoint of the markets overall we think that the economy is in a good shape though there is some slowdown. But overall we are still positive on the economy.\n\nWhat gives you the confidence that the worst is behind us because frankly, inflation may be down, but globally there are still a lot of concerns, still a lot of moving parts, the war is not over and you do not know where the next bazooka could be coming from?\n\nThere are still a lot of moving parts. So I think from a domestic economy standpoint, we are well placed. However, from a global standpoint there are still, as you rightly said, there are a lot of moving parts.\n\nGlobally, the developed markets have not seen higher interest rates and they are still grappling with it and we do not know how that is going to shape up. So from our perspective, overall though domestic economy is looking good, however, the geopolitical scene still remains fluid and we will have to watch out how it pans out over the next three to six months.\n\nLast time when we met, your portfolio positioning was centred around Tata Com, Cipla, Tata Motors, Telecom and Media; has your portfolio positioning changed because a lot has changed in the world in the last six-eight months?\n\nOur portfolio positioning does not change so rapidly. Generally, our average holding periods are five years. So our change in positioning is very slow. And therefore, not much has changed since we last spoke. Of course, there would be some granular changes in terms of maybe addition of a couple of names and maybe selling off one or two names. But by and large, our positioning does not really change very rapidly.\n\nYou were not overweight on banks and we discussed this briefly. Given that bank is in the leadership sector and banking is where the easy multiplier of the economy is visible. Was that a conscious call or you could revisit your call?\n\nWe like banks. I mean, clearly banks are in a very good position overall from a structural and cyclical standpoint. However, I think there are opportunities out there which are according to us better placed where businesses will grow faster.\n\nAnd exactly what you said, because the overall macro looks much better. Of course, banks will benefit but our sense is some of the other companies will grow faster and that is really why we are underweight in banks. Underweight in banks is not because we do not like banks, it is more because we like other opportunities better.\n\nWhat are these other opportunities that you think are more lucrative than banks altogether?\n\nWe are looking at bottom-up ideas across sectors. So from our perspective, it is not one particular sector. Of course, as you know, we have healthcare as our largest sector, followed by telecom, but there are ideas in hard infrastructure areas.\n\nThere are ideas in auto component space. We have companies across a broad range of industries. So we are more bottom-up investors. We take a more longer-term structural view on businesses and that is exactly how we are positioned.\n\nSo our positioning is more bottom-up in terms of what we like rather than saying that we are top-down in terms of how a particular sector is looking.\n\nWithin your existing top 10 portfolio holdings though have you added weight anywhere?\n\nYes, we have added weight in some of the auto component companies. We have added weight in some of the infra companies. So from our perspective, we are looking at businesses which we think structurally are well-positioned and hopefully will accelerate as we go into our economic recovery post the slowdown that we are witnessing right now.\n\nWhat is your outlook when it comes to the entire earnings season? Have you spotted any interesting pockets that you believe have outperformed or ones that have underperformed?\n\nOur sense is that Indian companies are navigating the current slowdown reasonably well. So to us, the earnings have surprised us but for a few segments of the market where in case of say, consumer discretionary we see a clear slowdown in terms of the revenue growth. Similarly, we see similar thing happening in IT. But by and large, our sense is that overall, the businesses are navigating this very well and therefore it is visible in terms of the earnings as well in the fourth quarter. So yes, overall I think definitely a positive earnings season for the market.",

            "body": "There are still a lot of moving parts. So I think from a domestic economy standpoint, we are well placed. However, from a global standpoint there are still, as you rightly said, there are a lot of moving parts.\"Globally, the developed markets have not seen higher interest rates and they are still grappling with it and we do not know how that is going to shape up,\" says Rushabh Sheth, Co-CIO, Karma Capital.\n\nIt is an all-time high on the Bank Nifty and Nifty is 400 points away from an all-time high. The tide has turned in favour of Indian equities. Do you think this turn is going to be a long one and we are in for more gains before the year ends?\n\nIf you look at the economy, I think we have kind of managed the higher interest rates reasonably well. I think the inflation seems to be peaking out and hopefully the interest rates also should follow suit. So our sense is that from a standpoint of the markets overall we think that the economy is in a good shape though there is some slowdown. But overall we are still positive on the economy.\n\nWhat gives you the confidence that the worst is behind us because frankly, inflation may be down, but globally there are still a lot of concerns, still a lot of moving parts, the war is not over and you do not know where the next bazooka could be coming from?\n\nThere are still a lot of moving parts. So I think from a domestic economy standpoint, we are well placed. However, from a global standpoint there are still, as you rightly said, there are a lot of moving parts.\n\nGlobally, the developed markets have not seen higher interest rates and they are still grappling with it and we do not know how that is going to shape up. So from our perspective, overall though domestic economy is looking good, however, the geopolitical scene still remains fluid and we will have to watch out how it pans out over the next three to six months.\n\nLast time when we met, your portfolio positioning was centred around Tata Com, Cipla, Tata Motors, Telecom and Media; has your portfolio positioning changed because a lot has changed in the world in the last six-eight months?\n\nOur portfolio positioning does not change so rapidly. Generally, our average holding periods are five years. So our change in positioning is very slow. And therefore, not much has changed since we last spoke. Of course, there would be some granular changes in terms of maybe addition of a couple of names and maybe selling off one or two names. But by and large, our positioning does not really change very rapidly.\n\nYou were not overweight on banks and we discussed this briefly. Given that bank is in the leadership sector and banking is where the easy multiplier of the economy is visible. Was that a conscious call or you could revisit your call?\n\nWe like banks. I mean, clearly banks are in a very good position overall from a structural and cyclical standpoint. However, I think there are opportunities out there which are according to us better placed where businesses will grow faster.\n\nAnd exactly what you said, because the overall macro looks much better. Of course, banks will benefit but our sense is some of the other companies will grow faster and that is really why we are underweight in banks. Underweight in banks is not because we do not like banks, it is more because we like other opportunities better.\n\nWhat are these other opportunities that you think are more lucrative than banks altogether?\n\nWe are looking at bottom-up ideas across sectors. So from our perspective, it is not one particular sector. Of course, as you know, we have healthcare as our largest sector, followed by telecom, but there are ideas in hard infrastructure areas.\n\nThere are ideas in auto component space. We have companies across a broad range of industries. So we are more bottom-up investors. We take a more longer-term structural view on businesses and that is exactly how we are positioned.\n\nSo our positioning is more bottom-up in terms of what we like rather than saying that we are top-down in terms of how a particular sector is looking.\n\nWithin your existing top 10 portfolio holdings though have you added weight anywhere?\n\nYes, we have added weight in some of the auto component companies. We have added weight in some of the infra companies. So from our perspective, we are looking at businesses which we think structurally are well-positioned and hopefully will accelerate as we go into our economic recovery post the slowdown that we are witnessing right now.\n\nWhat is your outlook when it comes to the entire earnings season? Have you spotted any interesting pockets that you believe have outperformed or ones that have underperformed?\n\nOur sense is that Indian companies are navigating the current slowdown reasonably well. So to us, the earnings have surprised us but for a few segments of the market where in case of say, consumer discretionary we see a clear slowdown in terms of the revenue growth. Similarly, we see similar thing happening in IT. But by and large, our sense is that overall, the businesses are navigating this very well and therefore it is visible in terms of the earnings as well in the fourth quarter. So yes, overall I think definitely a positive earnings season for the market.",

            "title": "Nifty Pharma sees muted performance in 2023; can the stocks change course going ahead?",
            "body": "While most sectoral indices rose with healthy gains, the Nifty Pharma index fell almost by a per cent in the early trade on Monday (May 29), dragged by losses in shares of select heavyweights, including Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma and Divi's Laboratories.\n\nThe pharma sector appears to have lost its mojo after a dream run during the Covid-19 pandemic due to elevated raw material prices, regulatory concerns and price erosion in the generics business in key US markets.\n\nHowever, many analysts now believe that one should look at pharma stocks for the medium to long term as the growth prospects of Indian pharma companies have improved while the valuations of their shares have come down due to the correction.\n\n\"One should look at pharma stocks with a medium-long term horizon as valuations are attractive, earnings are expected to improve and multiples may expand gradually,\" said Cyndrella Carvalho, a pharma research analyst at JM Financial Institutional Securities.\n\n\"The medium-term outlook for the pharma sector is positive. We expect a gradual US recovery as the pace of ANDA approvals accelerates and price erosion stabilises. US business growth will primarily come from complex generics and innovation; we believe those companies with strong R&D capabilities and low compliance risk can participate in this growth,\" said the analyst.\n\nCarvalho expects the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) to grow in double digits led by 6-7 per cent price growth, 2-3 per cent new launches and 2-4 per cent volume growth in FY24.\n\n\"India markets will see field force expansion, participation in patent expiries and increased mergers and acquisitions. We expect emerging markets and the rest of the world markets to report double-digit growth as supply chain challenges and adverse forex impact eases,\" said Carvalho.\n\nCarvalho observed that the March quarter earnings of the pharma sector players have been mixed primarily due to concerns around margins and lacklustre US base business growth.\n\n\"US business surprised on the upside primarily due to higher gRevlimid contribution. While other business revenues were broadly in line, EBITDA margins (ex-Revlimid) were weak due to subdued US base business growth and NLEM's impact on domestic business,\" Carvalho pointed out.\n\n\"Gross margins improved marginally as high-cost inventory got exhausted and we expect this trend to continue going forward. EM/ ROW markets performed well during the quarter. Notably, most companies under our coverage have strengthened their balance sheet and are scouting for inorganic opportunities,' Carvalho said.\n\nGirish Sodani, Head of Equity Market at Swastika Investmart underscored that the pharmaceutical market in India had revenues dip for the second consecutive month in March 2022 after expanding for 17 consecutive months up until that point.\n\n\"The industry's revenue decreased by 2 per cent. The net sales and net earnings of the major companies, including Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Abott India, decreased. Other publicly traded drug manufacturers also reported a single-digit reduction, demonstrating the extremely slow expansion of the pharmaceutical industry in India,\" Sodani observed.\n\n\"Low growth in the pharmaceutical industry on the basis of a few points: volumes fell for important treatments including antibiotics and supplements, a surplus of Covid-19 medicines in stock, a spike in raw material prices and lots more. The biggest challenge has been the expensive valuations in select pockets of pharma space where stocks went up three, or four times in a very short period of time because of Covid-led products driving or expected to drive their substantial growth,\" Sodani pointed out.\n\nSodani is positive about the Indian pharma players.\n\n\"The outlook is definitely positive for the pharma sector. We are expecting double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years. That should help in maintaining the valuations of the industry. Our expectation is that it will grow at around 10-11 per cent and there will be certain companies which will be growing faster than that also depending on the portfolio,\" said Sodani.\n\nHe said India is more of a structural growth story and it will remain so, which is why Indian pharma companies' valuations are at a much premium compared to the generic companies.\n\nSodani expects double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years which should help in maintaining the valuations and there will be some pockets in terms of companies who will be doing much better and that is why we are positive on select stocks.\n\nThe immense growth potential of the sector is a key positive for the sector.\n\nRead more: Indian Pharma industry expected to reach about 13% in global pharma market: Report\n\n\"139 new pharma projects worth ₹7,000 crore got the nod in FY23. According to the EY FICCI Report, the Indian pharmaceutical market is anticipated to reach $130 billion in value by the end of 2023 along with a few government policies which give direct benefits like Export Promotion Council for Medical Devices & National Medical Device Policy 2023,\" said Sodani.\n\n\"Picks from the pharma sector can be Zydus Life and Cipla for the mid to long-term for an upside of 10-15 per cent,\" Sodani said.\n\nRead all market-related news here",

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices opened higher on Monday as global cues turned positive after a tentative US debt deal was reached over the weekend. The development has provided a major boost to global markets, especially banking and financial services stocks.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex was up 458.58 points to 62,960.27 at around 9:35 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 114.10 points to trade at 18,613.15. All the broader market indices were also trading in positive territory as bulls dominated proceedings in early trade.\n\nMost of the sectoral indices, including heavyweights Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services, rose nearly 1 per cent. Nifty FMCG, Nifty IT, Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty also provided support.\n\nAlso Read | Biden, McCarthy appear near two-year deal on US debt ceiling as default looms\n\nThe top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were M&M, SBI Life, HDFC, HDFC Life and IndusInd Bank. On the other hand, the top losers were ONGC, Sun Pharma, Powergrid Corporation, Divi's Laboratories and Cipla.\n\nDomestic markets were expected to open on a positive note today as the SGX Nifty traded higher. This was due to improved global cues after US President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy on Saturday reached a tentative deal. It will now have to be approved by Congress.\n\nAnalysts said the deal would be good for stock markets around the world as it would end the uncertainty around the possibility of a potential US default. While the challenge for the US is not over yet, the tentative deal has provided a great deal of comfort to stock markets around the world, including India.\n\nFor Dalal Street, the combination of the potential US debt deal and sustained buying by foreign and domestic institutional investors is likely to fuel the momentum going forward.\n\nProvision data from the NSE indicated that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought shares worth Rs 350.15 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased shares worth Rs 1840.98 crore on May 26.\n\nDeven Mehata, research analyst at Choice Broking, said, \"The charts indicate that the Nifty may get support at 18,420, followed by 18,350 and 18,300. If the index advances, 18,600 would be the initial key resistance level to watch out for, followed by 18,650 and 18,700.\"\n\n\"As anticipated, the Nifty has broken out to the upside above 18450 on May 26th, 2023, and the Bank Nifty has the potential to set a new all-time high on the initial gap up,\" he added.\n\n\"The outlook is still positive, and investors should buy on dips. Traders may feel the fear of missing out the rally and may buy on the higher side where the risk-reward ratio is unfavourable, thus we recommend buying on dips with a stop-loss of 18300 on a closing basis.\"",

            "body": "Nagpur: The district and the entire Vidarbha region have a higher prevalence of sickle cell and thalassaemia blood disorders. However, the region's largest government hospital, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Nagpur, cannot conduct the HPCL test which is necessary for detecting these disorders.\n\nThe High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPCL) test can determine if an expectant mother has a blood disorder. In the next stage, the fetus can also be tested for a blood disorder, and doctors may recommend medical termination of pregnancy to prevent the birth of a child with a blood disorder.\n\nShockingly, GMCH has not conducted any tests on expectant mothers since 2014 revealed a response from the GMCH administration to an RTI query. Newborns are also not tested for sickle cell or thalassemia at GMCH.\n\nThese facilities are not available even at Mayo Hospital. The HPCL tests and maternal as well as fetal screening are only conducted at one government-owned facility, Daga Women's Hospital. However, even there, the HPCL tests are sponsored by an NGO and Nagpur's Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Centre as part of their public health project.\n\nRTI activists Pranali Patle of the People's Health Forum filed this query seeking information about the HPCL tests. \"We have been following the issues faced by sickle cell and thalassaemia patients for a long time. The HPCL test can detect blood disorders while the baby is still in the womb. Mandatory HPCL testing can ultimately eliminate thalassaemia and sickle cell,\" she said.\n\nRaj Khandare, coordinator of the Patients' Rights Forum, said they have requested the district collector to intervene and initiate HPCL tests at GMCH. \"Deferasirox, a medicine previously available from Cipla or Sun pharma was suddenly replaced by Bajaj company's Deferajaj in government hospitals. The cost of these medicines is higher. Patients demand reintroduction of the old medicines,\" he added.\n\nAdditionally, the issue of NAT-tested blood for patients who require regular transfusions is pending with the administration.\n\n\"Nucleic acid testing facilities are only available in select private blood banks, and these banks charge more for NAT-tested blood,\" said Khandare.",

            "title": "Indian Pharma companies: Do pipelines justify valuation assigned to US business?",
            "body": "The leading Indian pharma companies operate from three main markets: India, the US and other emerging markets (EM). In our earlier Big Story on Indian Pharma, in June 2022, we highlighted the robustness of branded markets (India and emerging markets) compared to the challenges in US generics. We also discussed the various pathways companies are adopting to secure growth in the US through differentiated pipelines.\n\nHere, we build on the argument and assess the market valuations assigned to US business vis-à-vis their pipelines to ascertain over- or undervalued opportunities.\n\nHow we valued the parts\n\nValuation assigned to India, the US and emerging markets, based on respective growth opportunities, are summed up to arrive at the fair value in the SOTP method of valuation. Inversely, by stripping value assigned to India and Emerging Markets (EMs) (by way of peer multiples), one can judge the value being bestowed on the remaining US business.\n\nCompanies focused only on Indian markets (Mankind, Eris, Abbott India and Sanofi India) are currently trading at a range of 18-36 times EV/EBITDA (trailing) with an average of 24 times. This valuation is on account of 'branded' nature of the Indian market with pricing power, unless interrupted by NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines). .\n\nWe have assigned 20-22 times EV/EBITDA to Indian businesses (a 10-20 per cent discount to average). The multiple is then applied to Indian segment's EBITDA contribution. We have assumed Indian EBITDA margin to be 100 bps higher than company EBITDA margin. These assumptions are directional and may vary within companies.\n\nThe other two businesses consisting of emerging pharma markets sales and API business is valued at 12 times and 10 times respectively and EBITDA margin to be lower than company average by 100 bps considering volatility and non-core operations. Stripping out India and EM Enterprise value (EV) from consolidated EV, the EV assigned to US segment and hence the EV/EBITDA of the segment can be implied.\n\nThe resultant US business metric, EV/EBITDA, is then compared to US peers -- either generics or innovators -- based on the pipeline product mix of the companies. Companies operating primarily in US generics (Aurobindo from India, Teva, Perrigo, Viatris and Hikma) trade at a range of 7-15 times EV/EBITDA (trailing) with an average of 10 times. The constant price erosion of US generics is well reflected in the valuation range.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are Innovator companies that trade at 10-30 times EV/EBITDA, which is based on the patent cliff timeline, portfolio in ramping stage and pipeline expectations. Novo Nordisk (29 times EV/EBITDA) and AstraZeneca (22 times) are trading at a premium, compared to Merck or Roche (12-15 times range). Pfizer and Sanofi (the MNC) with weakly perceived pipeline replacing patent losses are trading at 6-9 times EV/EBITDA.\n\nBased on the above assumptions, here is what our analysis of the valuation of the US business of 5 Indian pharma companies reveals:\n\nCipla: Undervalued, but overhang from plant issues\n\nCipla's implied valuation for US business may be in the range of 4.5-8.1 times EV/EBITDA, which is below the benchmark. US business delivered 17 per cent CAGR growth in preceding five years compared to India's 11 per cent CAGR growth at Cipla. Even ignoring the strong growth (ascribed to one-time gRevlimid bump-up in FY23), the strong pipeline makes the case for valuing Cipla's US business higher, with plant status as the spoiler.\n\nAlong with two respiratory product launches, two peptide launches and gRevlimid launch have boosted US performance. The pipeline includes five respiratory assets of which three have been filed, one complex generic and four peptide injectables. The respiratory pipeline includes gAdvair with end market sales of above $700 million, despite three generic launches so far. The overall pipeline falls on the higher end of complexity spectrum, which implies a lower than 'plain generics' level of erosion and higher margins. This should support Cipla's US segment valuation in the 10-12 times EV/EBITDA range that speciality generic manufacturers command, including Perrigo.\n\nDr Reddy's and Zydus Lifesciences: Fairly valued\n\nDr Reddy's\n\nDr Reddy's has been a US-centric business along with fair contribution from EMs, mainly Russia and CIS countries. Implied US business valuations range 7.5-8.4 times EV/EBITDA which, in our view, is fair, considering the pipeline.\n\nDr Reddy's 180-day exclusivity window, in an already lucrative gRevlimid opportunity, may close in Q4FY23. But post-exclusivity it should still generate sufficient cash flows in FY24. The company aims to launch 25 products in FY24 (launched 25 in FY23). The launch number is barely sufficient to offset the expected annual erosion of 8 per cent in the base portfolio, which is now around $1.2 billion per year. If the company manages to augment value added products (similar to gNexavar, gVasopressin last year) in launch-mix, it may possess a fair chance of reporting growth in the US.\n\nDr Reddy's has a strong OTC presence even in the US, which it intends to expand from 4 to 15 in the next few years. Cross-leveraging its biosimilar base, currently marketed in EM primarily, is under way. One partnered product is about to launch in the US and one more is expected to be filed A few more biosimilars are in the pipeline.\n\nThe well-rounded US generics strategy of Dr.Reddy's -- numbers to offset erosion and complex products to secure growth -- matches its implied valuation (8 times EV/EBITDA). This has evolved after the company wrote off its proprietary development plan for US markets and chose the safer approach.\n\nZydus Lifesciences\n\nZydus' US business trades at 11-12 times EV/EBITDA. Incidentally, the segment outlook is also similar to Dr.Reddy's: a whole lot of simple generic launches along with a few complex launches. But the company has a background in unveiling complex limited competition products regularly, which explains the slight premium to Dr.Reddy's. Current mix includes Asacol HD, gRevlimid and Topiramate, which can be classified as complex similar to the five launched in previous years. But in the current plan, Zydus seems intent on delivering high number of launches (planned 30-35 launches per year) including complex products, which should comfortably offset the single-digit erosion in the base of $926 million in FY23.\n\nZydus' current mix, along with filings for five more complex launches in next few years, should sustain mid-single digit growth in US segment despite erosion in base portfolio. With recent clearance for its Moraiya facility, the company can unlock its complex product pipeline, including transdermal products along a new solid dosages facility to support the high launch plan\n\nZydus also bears a strong New Chemical Entity (NCE) optionality, even though not included in valuation. The company's in-house product, Saroglitazar, is under Phase II(b)/III clinical trials in the US for PBC (primary biliary cholangitis). Saroglitazar is a leading driver in India, approved for NAFLD and NASH -- indications related to inflamed liver conditions.\n\nSun Pharma: US Valuations akin to innovator business\n\n:\n\nAssuming India valuation range of 20-22 times EV/EBITDA, Sun Pharma's US segment's implied valuation ranges 26-28 times EV/EBITDA. Even assigning 25 per cent premium to multiples in India, EM and other business, on account of market leader status, the implied EV/EBITDA range of US descends only to 20-22 times EV/EBITDA.\n\nThis valuation range of 20-30 times is applied to innovator companies in their up-cycle stage. Global speciality revenues (largely from the US) of Sun Pharma account for an average of 75 per cent of US sales, excluding Taro in FY23, and are growing at 26 per cent YoY. This is double the US revenue growth rate in FY23. This implies that the valuation range and the revenue contribution are in line and pointing towards a high speciality mix, which justifies the valuation range\n\nEven within the 'innovator' bracket, the upper end of the valuation range can be attributed to the ramping stage of the portfolio and strong replacement value in the pipeline. The current speciality portfolio is led by Ilumya (approved for Psoriasis), Cequa (dry eye disease), Winlevi (acne) along with Odomzo, Levulan, and Absorica. The largest Ilumya is expected to reach peak sales of $500-700 million in the next two years.\n\nThe pipeline, on the other hand, is led by deuruxolitinib, a best-in-class asset for alopecia treatment, which has cleared Phase III stage and acquired as part of Concert Pharma for $576 million. The asset though has faced SAE (serious adverse event) in further trials recently but is not expected to be a major impediment. Ilumya is also undergoing Phase 3 trials for Psoriatic arthritis. The other pipeline includes assets for Atopic dermatitis (Phase 2), pain (Phase 2), and even a GLP asset for diabetes (Phase 1) which is most lucrative pathway in diabetes currently.\n\nLupin: Strong expectations drive overvaluation\n\nLupin's US business bears implied valuation range of 26-28 times EV/EBITDA, which is in the overvalued range for the complex generics pipeline of Lupin.\n\nAt the current juncture after reporting lowest sales growth amongst peers in last five years and lowest EBITDA margins strong recovery is expected. gSpiriva, a respiratory asset with end market sales at $700 million and a three-player market, is expected in H1FY24 (after a few rounds of delay).\n\nAlso, gDiazepam gel, gNascobar spray, gDarunavir and gBromfenac, expected in FY24, should help rebound flagging sales in the US. Similarly the pipeline further down can veer towards high value injectables and inhalation assets with R&D focussed on such assets. A biosimilar approval and launch is also expected for Lupin in FY24-25.\n\nOutside of pipeline assumptions, recovery of margins also seems to be built into the current overvaluation. Lupin's management expects close to 300 bps improvement in EBITDA margins by FY24 to 15 per cent and further improvement to 18 per cent in FY25, compared to 12 per cent currently in FY23. The strong launch plan and ongoing cost savings plan do support assumption of margin recovery, but the valuation expectation based on the same would be stretched.\n\nWhat investors should watch out for\n\nGiven the over/under valuation, investors need a calibrated approach to position oneself in the stocks. In case of Cipla, the way plants regulatory status unravels will have a bearing on the stock. Meanwhile, de-risking launch schedule by transferring products or additional competition in gAdvair will aid or hurt the valuations respectively. Dr Reddy's and Zydus Lifesciences, though fairly valued currently are heading towards a glass ceiling of sorts.\n\nAs the portfolio size increases to $1.5 - 2 billion a year, assuming $3-4 million per plain generic launch, the two would need 40 launches per annum just to report flat earnings growth in US. This would imply a high regulatory oversight and execution risks, just as Aurobindo faced in the last two years.\n\nLupin's overvaluation is riding on strong launch schedule to revive earnings growth and also to scale-up margins. The pipeline should deliver on expected lines, timing and market share gains wise, to support the valuations. Delay in product approval, any new plant issues or announcement of new competition can impact the precarious valuations.\n\nSun Pharma's current set of products sold in the US and the pipeline under development support the innovator-level valuations for the business. As explained, innovator valuations can swing from single digit to 30 times as pipeline is exhausted or replenished. Ability of Sun to consistently replenish the portfolio pipeline without straining its financials (in form of oversized acquisitions) is crucial to support the valuations.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 27, 2023",

            "body": "Kolkata, May 26 (UNI) Insufficient awareness about asthma, a respiratory disease affecting nearly 7.9pc of Indian children, and misconceptions and perceived myths associated with its cornerstone treatment inhalation therapy, have resulted in many cases going undiagnosed and even untreated, according to an expert.\n\nAll this ultimately results in poor control of asthma, a widespread non-communicable disease and the most common chronic condition among children with 80pc of asthmatics experiencing symptoms during the first six years of their life.\n\n\"Paediatric asthma can be a distressing condition for both the child and its family. It is a chronic condition that requires ongoing and often intensive management to keep symptoms under control. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can help reduce the frequency as well as severity of the condition,\" said child specialist Subhasis Roy.\n\n\"However, misunderstandings about the disease as well as its most widely used and recommended treatment i.e., inhalation therapy have led to parents often concealing the condition including for societal reasons, putting off treatment until symptoms worsening. This ultimately results in the insufficient management of the condition as well as a reduced quality of life, that includes frequent hospitalisations and missed school days,\" said Roy.\n\nIn such a scenario, it is important for parents and caregivers to work closely with their child's healthcare provider to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to adhere to the best-suited asthma management strategies.\n\n\"It is crucial to raise awareness about the true impact of asthma on children's lives and to dispel any myths or misconceptions about the disease as well as its recommended method of treatment. By doing so, we can empower families to seek the necessary care and support for their children to reach their full potential,\" said Roy.\n\nMay is being observed as World Asthma Awareness month.\n\nPharmaceutical major Cipla has launched a general patient and public awareness initiative - 'Tuffies' - directing more targeted awareness on improving respiratory care among children, especially those living with asthma.\n\nIn a bid to overcome myths and stigma associated with chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and its treatment, the campaign is targeted at engaging children between the ages 5 through 10 years of age and their caregivers. While the campaign has been launchesld with the comic book, an animated video series is to follow, the company said in a media release.\n\nUNI BM SSP ARN",

            "body": "NEW DELHI: While valuations on Dalal Street have fallen in line with 5-year and 10-year historical averages following a rangebound trade over the last two years, analysts believe they have still not fallen to levels that give investors comfort to put money aggressively. That said, nearly half of index stocks are below their 10-year averages and can offer decent returns to investors.\n\nTrendlyne data suggests these 20 stocks have 5-35% upside scope and hold to strong buy ratings from analysts.\n\nFor UPL, analysts have an average target upside of 35%. Out of 23 calls on the stock, 17 have strong buy ratings, 3 buy ratings, 2 hold calls and one sell call. UPL has a 12-month trailing PE of 14.03 times vs 10-year average PE of 17.32 times.\n\nBrokerage Prabhudas Lilladher recently slashed the FY24E/25E estimates for UPL by 16%/12% and target multiple from 14x earlier to 12x currently, to factor in subdued growth and margin outlook in the near term. It, however, maintained a BUY post the earnings show at a target of Rs 850.\n\nAs for Hindalco, its TTM PE stands at 7.92 times currently against the 10-year average of 12.52 times. The stock, which declared its Q4 earnings on Wednesday, has 14 strong buy out of 20 recommendations and no sell calls. It has an average upside scope of 30%, Trendlyne data further suggests.\n\nHDFC Bank, SBI, Axis Bank and M&M are also below their 10-year average while they have an upside scope of over 20% each in the next 12 months. This is when these stocks have gained 20-37% in the last one year already.\n\nHDFC Bank's counterpart HDFC is also trailing its 10-year average PE of 20.17 times as stock trades at 19.11 times. With the merger between the two entities just 4-5 weeks away, analysts on Thursday said the move would result in a lower net interest margin (NIM) for the lender this year.\n\nThe bank expects NIM - a key profitability measure - to fall to 3.7%-3.8% in 2023-24 from 4.1% a year ago due to the merger, Nomura analysts wrote in a report.\n\nNTPC, Apollo Hospitals, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Dr. Reddy's Labs and ONGC are among companies that are trading at a PE multiple of below their historical average. Analysts expect them to give gains in the high to mid-teens.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

            "body": "MUMBAI: The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the world's first oral antiviral, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe Coronavirus, including hospitalization or death.\n\nPaxlovid, manufactured by US biggie Pfizer is the fourth drug -- and first oral antiviral pill -- approved by the USFDA to treat Covid-19 in adults. So far, Paxlovid was being sold under an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US.\n\nWith the pandemic now in the endemic stage, oral treatments or pills are believed to be a potential game changer for mild to moderate infections.\n\nA clutch of domestic companies including Cipla, Dr Reddy's, Torrent, Hetero, Biocon, Emcure, Granules India, Glenmark and Sun Pharma signed agreements last year with Medicines Patent Pool for the manufacture of the generic drug substance and product. Overall, 35 generic manufacturers globally signed agreements with MPP to produce low-cost, generic versions of Pfizer's oral COVID-19 treatment nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir, for supply in 95 low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn India, Hetero announced 'NIRMACOM', the world's first generic version of Paxlovid, had received WHO prequalification in December. The Hyderabad-based company also has EUA approval from the Drugs Controller General of India to manufacture and market the oral antiviral here. Now with the USFDA green light, the production of generics will get a further push, resulting in better availability and accessibility of the antiviral. Earlier this year, the demand for Paxlovid in China had shot up, resulting in a massive demand for Indian generic versions.\n\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the US, approval of a new drug requires, among other things, substantial evidence of effectiveness and a demonstration of safety for the drug's intended use(s). In considering approval of a drug, the FDA conducts a benefit-risk assessment based on rigorous scientific standards to ensure that the product's benefits outweigh its risks for the intended population\n\n\"While the pandemic has been challenging for all of us, we have made great progress mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our lives,\" said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Today's approval demonstrates that Paxlovid has met the agency's rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness, and that it remains an important treatment option for people at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including those with prior immunity''.\n\nIt may be noted that the antiviral is not approved or authorized for use as a pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of Coronavirus.",

            "title": "South Africa begins its own production of groundbreaking HIV-prevention drug to make it affordable within the continent",
            "body": "South Africa will soon begin production of the groundbreaking HIV-prevention drug, long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA), finally making the life-saving treatment affordable within the African continent. The treatment, which must be injected every two months, almost entirely eliminates the risk of becoming infected by HIV through sex. This development is expected to help millions of people at risk within Africa.\n\nFollowing a collaborative agreement between the developers of CAB-LA, ViiV Healthcare, and the United Nations-backed Medicine Patent Pool (MPP), an HIV-preventative will be produced in South Africa for the first time. This has great implications for Africa as a whole, with an affordable solution to a problem that has long been a source of pain for the continent.\n\nA branded version does exist, and in the USA just one injection costs $3,500. But thanks to this new agreement which was announced in March 2023, a generic version of the drug can finally be produced. A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that contains the same chemical substance as a drug that was originally protected by chemical patents. This is important as it drastically cuts the cost involved for governments looking to obtain the treatment for their populations. While there are already free of cost HIV-prevention drugs available across much of Africa, they must be taken daily and are not as effective as the long-lasting cabotegravir injection, which must only be taken every two months. The drug almost entirely eliminates the risk of becoming infected by HIV through sex.\n\nIt is rare for medicine to be produced within Africa, despite certain drugs such as HIV-preventatives being in higher demand there than anywhere else. In fact, only 38 countries across the world have any drug manufacturers, and even less than that actually develop new drugs. The new availability of this highly effective drug is expected to help millions of Africans who are currently at risk of HIV infection.\n\nThe company which will produce the drug, an Indian group called Cipla, received permission to do so back in March through an agreement between its developers and the United Nations-supported MPP. The MPP state that:\n\n\"OUR MISSION IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO, AND FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF, LIFE-SAVING MEDICINES FOR LMICS. WE DO THIS THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO VOLUNTARY LICENSING AND PATENT POOLING.\"\n\nTo achieve this goal, they work hand in hand with civil society, international organisations, industry, patient groups and governments. Between 2012 and 2021, through partnerships with 18 patent holders and 56 generic manufacturers, they provided 26.91 billion doses of treatment, saving at least 18,000 lives.\n\nThe work of groups such as the MPP is essential to ensuring that low-income nations can give essential and life-saving care to their populations. Often, people in need are left to suffer and potentially die because they do not have access to specialist medicines. The developers of the medicines themselves are usually guilty of financial gatekeeping, driving for profit as opposed to producing medicine for the common good.\n\nThe gatekeeping of essential and lifesaving drugs by pharmaceutical companies has long been a problem. This problem really came to attention during the COVID pandemic, when rich nations were able to buy up billions of doses of the vaccine - more than they needed - while low-income nations were left to suffer.\n\nAllowing Cipla to produce the vital drug in South Africa is a big first step, but there is still a lot more that could be achieved through further cooperation with drug producers. Firstly, allowing more companies to produce the same drug will improve availability and help to negate future shortages, as long as the companies which receive access to the knowledge are ready to produce in the quantities required. In addition to this, increased competition means lower prices. The US based Food and Drug Administration showed in one report that products with six or more generic producers were on average 95% cheaper than when only a single branded option was available.\n\nRegardless of the imperfect situation, the ability to produce a generic version of CAB-LA in South Africa will save countless lives and is a victory in the ongoing struggle to make lifesaving drugs available to all in need.",

The brokerage house believes that the price will rally significantly between 6% to 18%. All companies reported mixed results for the fourth quarter. The details are given below.\n\n1. Buy Abbot India shares at a Target price of Rs 25,243 (17.57% potential upside)\n\nAbbott India Limited (Abbott) reported weaker-than-anticipated net income in Q4FY2023. The gross margin declined ~273.0 bps y-o-y to ~43.4% and the EBITDA margin declined ~256 bps y-o-y to ~20.9% in Q4FY2023. PAT grew at a slower pace of ~9.5% y-o-y to Rs 231.4 crore though, which was lower than the stock-broking firm's estimate of ~Rs. 275 crore.\n\nThe EBITDA margin contraction can be attributed to an unfavorable product mix, increased raw-materials cost, and higher other operating expenses (~13.1% of sales in Q4FY2023 vs. ~11.9% in Q4FY2022), while employee costs reduced (~9.4% of sales in Q4FY2023 vs. ~10.8% of sales in Q4FY2022). Hence, operating profit or EBITDA declined by ~4.7% y-o-y to Rs. 280.1 crores, pointed Sharekhan.\n\nAdditionally, the company has declared a special dividend of Rs. 145 and a final dividend of Rs. 180 for FY2023, indicating a dividend yield of ~1.6%.\n\nHowever, Abbott's strong market leadership in its key therapy product categories such as gastro and gynecology continues to be the key positive. \"We maintain Buy with an unchanged price target of Rs. 25,243. The stock currently trades at 41.4x/35.6x its FY2024E/FY2025E EPS.\" added the broking firm.\n\n2. Hold Cipla Ltd shares at a target price of Rs 1,030 (9.81% potential upside)\n\nCipla's Q4FY2023 numbers were a mixed bag as it outperformed Sharekhan's expectations on the revenue front with revenue of ~Rs. 5,739 crore was above the estimate of Rs. 5,565.1 crore. While EBITDA came in line at ~Rs. 1,174 crore vs. the estimate of Rs. 1,169 crore and the adjusted PAT was at ~Rs. 653.7 crore, slightly below the estimate of ~Rs. 673.0 crore.\n\nHowever, some of Cipla's key facilities continue to languish under the USFDA scanner such as Indore and Goa. Also, the company's India segment revenue continues to grow at a tepid pace due to the high base effect associated with COVID-19 sales.\n\nBesides, the R&D spend is expected to continue to rise due to a likely increase in spend on a differentiated portfolio of products and biosimilars, which restricts the likelihood of EBITDA margin expansion over the short-medium term.\n\nHence, Sharekhan says \"We reduce the price target to Rs. 1030 (vs. before Rs. 1,080) and maintain HOLD on it as it trades at ~22.0x and ~19.0x its FY24 and FY25E EPS estimates vs. peers trading at ~18.3x and ~16.1x its FY24E and FY25E EPS estimates, indicating higher valuation.\"\n\n3. Buy Divis Laboratories Ltd shares at a target price of Rs 3,600 (6.41% potential upside)\n\nDivis Labs reported in-line results for Q4FY23 on the profit front. In Q4FY23, revenues declined ~22.5% y-o-y (up 14.2% q-o-q) to Rs. 1,951 crores (vs. the internal estimate of Rs 1,765 crore and consensus estimate of Rs 1,792 crore) this was driven by a ~6.3% y-o-y/~12.0% q-o-q rise in generic APIs sales (~59.0% of revenue) and ~44.3% y-o-y decline and ~17% q-o-q rise in custom synthesis revenue (~41.0% of revenue) in Q4FY23.\n\nThe gross profits fell ~33.1% y-o-y to Rs. 1,123 crore and gross margins declined ~912.0 bps y-o-y to ~57.6% in Q4FY23. EBITDA declined ~ 55.9% y-o-y to Rs. 488 crores (versus the internal estimate of Rs. 476 crores and the consensus estimate of Rs. 477 crores.)\n\nThe decline was due to a ~1.9% points decline in EBITDA margins to ~25.0% (versus internal estimate of ~27.0% and consensus estimate of ~26.6%) Net profits declined ~64.1% y-o-y (+4.6% q-o-q) to Rs. 321 crore (vs. internal estimate of Rs. 344 Cr and consensus estimate of Rs. 347 crore.)\n\nThe company has invested heavily in existing and new generic molecules' capacity expansion, backward integration, and custom synthesis segment. Another ~Rs 1200-1,500 crore is slated to be invested in the Kakinada III unit, which is likely to be commissioned by ~FY26-FY27.\n\nSharekhan feels that the margins are expected to continue to lag behind historical averages and normalise by ~FY26-27, as incremental sales come in from new generic and custom synthesis and contrast media APIs.\n\n\"We upgrade our Hold rating on Divis Laboratories (Divis) to Buy with a revised PT of Rs 3,600. The stock has corrected by ~21% over the last year and trades at ~38.6x and ~34.2x its FY2024/25E earnings versus peers that are trading at ~21x/17.1x its FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. It deserves premium valuations, as it clocks superior return ratios as compared to peers.\" the stock-broking firm added.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe stocks have been picked up from the brokerage reports of Shraekhan.

            "title": "Is dual drug filing the right tactic for pharma companies now?",
            "body": "Is dual drug filing the right tactic for pharma companies now?\n\nIntensive regulatory scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has become a major roadblock in the way of major Indian pharmaceutical companies to attempt a rebound in the subdued US market. A Form 483 being slapped by the US FDA with several serious observations on major manufacturing facilities of these drug-makers has turned into a daily occurrence in news headlines. So much so, that the news of the completion of inspection of any pharma manufacturing facility without observations is enough to send the company's stock ticking higher on the bourses. In the past year, several major manufacturing facilities, including Cipla and Lupin's Pithampur units, Sun Pharma's Halol unit, Aurobindo Pharma's Anakapalli unit, Dr Reddy's Srikakulam unit, and Ipca's Piparia unit are some that have been caught in regulatory snags. These regulatory challenges are hurting the financials of these companies, the fallout being the erosion in market share, shrinking margins and loss of revenue from the delay in launches of key drugs that have been filed from the manufacturing units under scrutiny. Nonetheless, some pharma majors may have finally managed to find their own jugaad to deal with the heavy hunting of the US regulatory body. True to the saying, 'Modern problems require modern solutions', some pharma majors have rolled out plans to file key drugs from two different manufacturing sites, in what may be the safest bid to de-risk launch delays. So, what are the chances of this becoming an industry-wide trend? Let's take a deep dive to know: Large-cap majors roll the carpet; will others follow the path? So far, only two major large-cap companies, namely Cipla and Sun Pharma, have chalked out plans to file key drug launches from two different sites. This will de-risk the chances of the launches getting stuck in the loop of regulatory setbacks, even if one site were to fail to pass the good manufacturing standards set by the US FDA. That's not all. Analysts on the Street are not just cheering this decision taken by Cipla and Sun Pharma, but they also anticipate others to follow suit. Mitesh Shah, Research Analyst - Pharmaceutical Sector at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, believes that other pharma companies should also conform to the trend. His major backing is the fact that the drugs tangled in regulatory mishaps belong to the high-margin and high-revenue category, and spending some extra money in filing them from two facilities will be offset by what they will bring to the table. On the flip side, a delay in the launch of these drugs will result in subsequent erosion of margin due to shrinking market size and eventually, loss of revenue opportunity. Also Read: Delayed drug launches to hurt Cipla's earnings in FY24 A similar optimism was stated by Kunal Randeria, Director, Nuvama Institutional Equities, who cheered the de-risking plans proposed by Cipla. He believes de-risking will reduce the regulatory overhang. Though there might be some delay in the initial approval of the new sites, but once done, that will ensure a more sustainable revenue stream from these major drugs. Some ifs, some buts Regardless of how smooth this route looks, there are challenges too, in its way, that have thus far prevented companies from looking at the option. One of the challenges is the technicalities involved. Vishal Manchanda, Pharma Analyst at Systematix Shares and Stocks (India), spoke of the lack of specific manufacturing abilities available at other units to produce the said drugs as being the major roadblock. Such a problem may arise especially for small and mid-size companies, with limited resources at their command. \"Some drugs require specialised manufacturing facilities which might not be available for some companies at two of their different sites, making it difficult for them to go down the path of dual filing,\" Manchanda explained. Shah also pointed out that some companies may be of the view that given that regulatory standards are the same for all manufacturing plants, dual filing may bring little change if practices followed in the two units are exactly the same. To answer this, another analyst on the Street spoke of the numerous complications involved in the process of getting the US FDA's approval. \"Maintaining regulatory compliance is very difficult, as the US FDA can even pin-point minuscule lapses to issue an observation, a major reason why one facility of the same company may be stuck in regulatory hurdles while the other may not,\" he said. Any small issue at the said plant on the day of inspection can result in receiving an observation, while the process of making the changes and adhering to those lapses in order to receive a final get-go takes some time. In such a case, it would be worth firing from two cylinders rather than pegging all hopes on one to maximise the chances of receiving approval. Another factor highlighted by Manchanda was the inevitable delays in the process. He stated that companies can only apply for a site transfer or addition once the drug and its manufacturing process have been cleared by the US FDA. Even in that case, some delays on account of site inspections for both the sites where the particular drug was being filed were inevitable. However, as Randeria pointed out, companies might soon come to realise that aside from the initial delay because of approvals, dual filing presents a much safer and more sustainable path towards hassle-free drug launches. Why the time is now? It has only been recently that the US FDA began tightening the screws of regulatory practices in its inspections, which resulted in major manufacturing facilities falling prey to mishaps. Much of the regulatory pressure faced by domestic pharma companies has been evident after physical checks began in full swing post the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is only now that these drug makers have started looking for ways to surpass the hurdles with all seriousness. It was correctly pointed out by Manchanda that urgency is the need of the hour, as these drug delays are leading to loss of revenue, especially at a time when the US market is in a rough patch. Summing it up, Mitesh Shah said, whether or not most pharma companies will jump onto the bandwagon of dual filing, only time will tell. However, it is definitely a step in the right direction.

            "title": "Evergreening Of Patents - Patent - India",
            "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nThe origin of the modern statutory patent system is generally traced back to the Venetian Patent Statute of March 19, 1474 which stipulated that patents may be granted for \"any new and ingenious device, not previously made\" provided it was useful. Since then, it has been the fundamental principle of the law of patents that they be granted only for inventions which are new and useful. That is to say it must have novelty and utility. Such is also the position under Indian law.\n\nAs patents generally provide a lucrative monopoly over a product or a process, it is often in the best interest of an inventor to obtain a patent though they only have a limited life. In India the term of a patent only extends to 20 years from the date of filing an application for the patent. Thus, many inventors are incentivised to find innovative and ingenious ways to obtain a new patent on the goods or processes which were previously patented. This process is commonly referred to as the evergreening of a patent.\n\nThis article intends to cover the legality of the practice of evergreening of patents as per Indian law by primarily analysing the relevant provisions of the Patents Act, 1970 (\"the Act\") and by highlighting the criteria for determining evergreening.\n\n\"Evergreening\" is an informal term used to label practices that have developed in certain jurisdictions wherein a trifling change is made to an existing product, and claimed as a new invention. The coverage/protection afforded by the alleged new invention is then used to extend the patentee's exclusive rights over the product, preventing competition.An example would be when in the pharmaceutical trade brand-name companies patent \"new inventions\" that are really just slight modifications of old drugs, it's called \"evergreening\".\n\nBased on the above, what would fall within the scope of 'trifling' would essentially determine whether there is an attempt at evergreening a patent or whether it is eligible to be patented, thus the door is not entirely shut on patenting an existing invention with some changes. In order to understand what constitutes a trifling change we must now direct our attention to the provisions of the Act.\n\nBefore, analysing the provision of the Act tackling evergreening we must first understand what can be patented. A patent can only be granted for an invention which is defined under Section 2(j) of the Act as a \"new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application\". The Act further defines an 'inventive step' under Section 2(ja) as \"a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art\". Thus, on a combined reading of the aforesaid sections, to qualify as an invention, a product must: (i) be new; (ii) be capable of being made or used in an industry; (iii) come into being as a result of an invention which has a feature that (a) entails technical advance over existing knowledge; or (b) has an economic significance and (c) makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\n\nNow, even if an invention meets the above outlined threshold it may still not be patentable if it is hit by the provisions of Section 3 of the Act. Section 3 stipulates what are not inventions for the purposes of the Act. It is here that we find the anti-evergreening provision embodied in Section 3(d) of the Act, which is reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n\"(d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any new property or new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless such known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.\n\nExplanation.-For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy;\"\n\nA perusal of Section 3(d) makes it clear that it applies where there is a 'mere discovery' of a new property/new use of a known substance of the 'mere use' of a known process, machine or apparatus. Unless, it results in the enhancement of the efficacy of the known substance or unless such known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. Resultantly, Section 3(d) has to be understood as a positive provision that in fact recognizes incremental innovation while cautioning that the incremental steps may sometimes be so little that the resultant product is no different from the original.\n\nWhether or not a patent for a particular invention would be hit by Section 3(d) must be determined on a case by case basis depending on the nature of the product or process. The standards applicable in this evaluation would of course also vary on the basis of the industry that the product or process pertains to.\n\nWith respect to pharmaceuticals, which have been the greatest generator of jurisprudence in this field in India, the Delhi High Court in Cipla Ltd v F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., held that Section 3(d) envisages a variety of derivatives of known substances, such as (i) a compound which is not active in itself, but is metabolized in the body to form an active drug known as prodrug. For eg., chloramphenicol succinate ester is used as an intravenous prodrug of chloramphenicol, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water; (ii) a composition (combination of two or more active ingredients or combination of a pharmaceutical carrier with a compound not used as a drug before); (iii) a drug delivery system which is a composition that its constituents enable to be administered in a particular way. As long as the product provides an enhancement to the known efficacy of the product, it would not be considered as 'evergreening' and would be patentable. With respect to pharmaceuticals this efficacy is to be adjudged on the basis of the 'therapeutic efficacy' of the product.\n\nIn the context of technological innovations, in a case where the suit patent was based on known elements but its novelty lied in the resultant increase in efficiency, the Delhi High Court in Communication Components Antenna Inc. v Ace Technologies Corp. negated an objection to the suit patent under Section 3(d) stating that the provision does not apply in cases where on the basis of existing technology, newer technology is developed and better efficiency is achieved. In this case the increase in efficiency was evaluated on the basis of the increase in the efficacy of the beams emitted by the antennae which were the subject of the suit patent.\n\nThe golden thread emanating from the above discussion is that evergreening a patent based on known substances or processes is impermissible in India. The only exception being if the applicant of a patent has been able to increase the efficacy of the product as provided for in Section 3(d) of the Act. This incentivises and protects real and discernible improvements, and mere inconsequential changes to known products would not pass muster. Thus, every application to patent an invention which is based on a known substance or process must be firmly based on an increase in efficacy without which it would not be patentable.",

            "body": "Global turmoil meets local resilience seems to be the major takeaway for investors as the March quarter earnings season draws to a close. Buoyant domestic demand bolstered corporate bottomlines across sectors, even as the lingering impact of inflation made its presence felt. 'The Great Indian Consumption Story' gave a fillip to banking, auto, telecom and FMCG firms. In contrast, the IT sector was the biggest casualty of the crisis of confidence plaguing the US banking industry. Some missteps of the past added to their woes. A number of companies posted eye-popping numbers largely due to statistical anomalies, while a few others met the Street's expectations with predictable ease. Here's a concise round-up of how the major companies fared in Q4 FY23 - Outperformers India Inc's biggies once again stamped their dominance on the results season. Leading the charge was Reliance Industries, which was propelled by its oil-to-chemicals, digital and retail engines. Management commentary on disciplined capital allocation- allayed concerns on the net debt front. Fellow conglomerate Adani Enterprises too had a standout quarter, with net profit more than doubling on account of strong operational performance across businesses. The stars of the show, however, were the banking and financial names. Robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality were the highlights of their Q4 showing. A round of applause for India's public sector banks, whose cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings. From posting a total net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017- 18, PSBs have indeed come a long way. The health of the overall Indian banking sector stood out in stark contrast to the Silicon Valley Banks and Credit Suisses of the world. Encouraging loan growth in the retail segment, which is seeing growing competitive intensity, was further testimony to the India growth story. This factor also benefitted the FMCG pack, which saw heartening profit growth, though volumes and margins trailed estimates amid still elevated input price pressures. ITC delivered a smoking hot set of numbers, aided by a 12 percent jump in cigarette volumes and post-pandemic revival in the hotel segment. The post-Covid pent-up demand fueled another cohort -- the auto majors. Product launches to cater to varied consumer preferences, price hikes and easing supply chain issues added to their momentum. Washouts It was a quarter to forget for India's IT giants. The banking crisis in the US - the bread-and-butter market for India's software services industry - meant that the companies were clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows. Add to this the ongoing concerns about the Western economies tipping into recession amid the aggressive rate hikes by the Fed, ECB et al, and we have a perfect bag of woes for investors. Commodities players too had a rough end to the fiscal, largely in tandem with softer prices globally, though Coal India was the victim of a characteristically PSU problem - a bloated wage bill. Also Read: Accumulate IT, pharma stocks over the next 1-2 years for long term investment, says this market expert Yes Bank bucked the positive trend in the banking space by posting a 45 percent drop in profits, prolonging the pain for its shareholders. Voltas, UPL, NTPC and UltraTech Cement suffered from varied causes, ranging from rising competition and stuttering sales to input price pressures. Mixed Show Companies in this list posted a mixed set of numbers. Most were in-line with estimates, with no surprises on either side of the spectrum, but a few marquee names wilted under pressures building up in some pockets of the economy. Take the case of Hindustan Unilever. India's largest fast-moving consumer goods company marked a steady end to FY23 with an around 10 percent uptick in both revenue and profit for the March quarter. However, it was the underlying volume growth of 4 percent which betrayed the persisting hangover of inflation, especially in rural areas which saw volumes shrinking 3 percent on-year. \"Looking forward, the near-term operating environment is likely to remain volatile. With inflation easing...and sequential softening in a few commodities, price and volume growths will rebalance,\" the company's CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta said. Weakness in rural demand also played spoilsport for Bajaj Auto, which also had to contend with challenges on the exports front. The challenging operating environment showed up in the quarterly numbers of a few more companies in this group. One-off cases Axis Bank posted a hefty Q4 net loss of Rs 5,728.42 crore on account of buying Citi Bank's India consumer business. Excluding the exceptional items, the private sector lender's profit would have soared 61 percent to Rs 6,625.29 crore. Tata Steel Q4 profit slumped 84 percent but still beat estimates. Dr Reddy's net profit jumped 10-fold to Rs 959.2 crore following one-off charges in the base quarter. Cipla Q4 net profit zoomed 45 percent on year to Rs 525.65 crore, but lagged expectations due to a one-time loss of Rs 182.2 crore on account of goodwill impairment for Yemen operations. Summing up the results season, Satish Menon, Executive Director at Geojit Financial Services, said the worst performer is IT, while the best is banking. Auto has also done well, but pent-up demand is slowing down. \"FMCG has been marginally below par due to low demand and higher operating costs while cement is encouraging. Businesses and sectors which have global exposure are showing a weak trend,\" he added.",

            "body": "Medication for chronic lung illnesses is often administered through inhalation using a respiratory inhaler. Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, and soft mist inhalers are just some of the tools that can be used to administer medication straight to the lungs and airways.\n\nAsk Us to Get Your Sample Copy Of The Report, Covering TOC and Regional Analysis @ https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/227\n\nMarket for Respiratory InhalerWorldwide: Drivers\n\nOver the forecast period, the market for respiratory inhaler worldwide is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 4.6% due to the rising incidence of asthma. For example, The Global Asthma Report 2018 estimates that 300 Mn people worldwide already suffer from asthma, with that number rising to 100 Mn by 2025.\n\nIn addition, the industry should benefit from the rising prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For example, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruction Disease projects that by 2030, COPD will be responsible for 4.5 Mn deaths worldwide every year.\n\nIn 2018, North America had a 40.4% value share of the market for respiratory inhaler worldwide, with Europe coming in second.\n\nMarket for Respiratory InhalerWorldwide: Restraints\n\nThe rising price of inhalers is the main factor restraining expansion of the market for respiratory Inhaler worldwide. For example, between 2013 and 2018, the average price of an Advair inhaler rose from US$ 316 Mn to US$ 496 Mn, and between 2013 and 2018, the price of an inhaler of Flovent rose from US$ 207 Mn to US$ 292 Mn.\n\nGrowth in the market is anticipated to be hampered by the rising popularity of substitute treatments, like oral medication or subcutaneous injections, which are sometimes provided for free by public hospitals, particularly in developing countries, and by some non-profit organizations.\n\nMarket for Respiratory Inhaler Worldwide: Opportunities\n\nA smart inhaler technology has been developed to aid patients in monitoring their doses and provides other benefits. Unlike traditional inhalers, \"smart\" ones include a built-in electronic chip and Bluetooth connectivity. Metered dose inhalers, nebulizers and dry powder inhalers can all use the sensors made by Adherium, Ltd. Several of these gadgets have touchscreens, audio/visual medication reminders, cloud-based portals for academics and physicians,mobile app connectivity, and the ability to personalize the user experience. Smartinhaler Live is a real-time data collecting tool developed by Adherium, Ltd.\n\nNebulizers are less in demand since breathing medications is a laborious process that takes a lot of time and effort. Also, nebulizers need routine servicing. Yet nebulizers can help with severe or acute asthma, especially in young children. As a result of hand weakness, coordination issues, or abundant mucus in the airways, nebulizers are also still utilized to treat patients who lack the ability to use an inhaler or other device.\n\nMarket participants have also noticed a rise in the use of inhaler devices with propeller systems, particularly for the care of individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Effective medical care is propelled by the use of sensors, mobile apps, data analytics, and service delivery.\n\nMarket for Respiratory InhalerWorldwide: Competitive Landscape\n\nProminent companies in the market of respiratory inhaler worldwide are AstraZeneca plc, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Cipla Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Merck & Co., Inc., OMRON Healthcare Europe B.V., PARI Medical Holding, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n\nMarket for Respiratory Inhaler Worldwide: Key Developments\n\nCompanies with a significant market presence are increasingly concentrating on developing and implementing partnership approaches to increase their share of the market. Project TWENTY21 is a European medical cannabis registry, and in January 2020, Senzer Pharmaceuticals teamed with Drug Science, a prominent independent scientific authority on medicines in the United Kingdom, to deploy the company's pharmaceutical respiratory device in the registry.\n\nMarket leaders are concentrating on expanding product distribution in order to increase their share of the market. For example, in December of this year, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. was given approval by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (India) to charge a premium for its digital dose inhaler (marketed under the brand name \"Digihaler\").\n\n𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐮𝐦 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐖𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐔𝐩 𝐓𝐨 𝟐𝟓% 𝐎𝐅𝐅 @ https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/buy-now/227\n\nQualitative Insights Impact of COVID-19 on Global Respiratory Inhalers Market\n\n☛ Identified business opportunities - Our market research report can be used to analyze potential markets and new products.

I believe that we are well positioned to participate in the promise of global biosimilars for the long-term. And while we are a global company that has launched our first product in 17 markets around the world, we remain committed and focused to bringing AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to Humira®, to patients in the United States, after regulatory approval,\" said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. \"We continue to work collaboratively with the FDA regarding both Biologic License Applications for AVT02 and are preparing for all possible scenarios, including resubmission of the first AVT02 BLA and hosting a possible reinspection of our manufacturing facility, which we would anticipate in 2023, if needed.\"\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech received from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a complete response letter (CRL) for the Company's Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02, a high-concentration biosimilar candidate for Humira® (adalimumab). The CRL noted that certain deficiencies conveyed following the FDA's recent reinspection of the company's Reykjavik facility must be satisfactorily resolved before the application may be approved. Alvotech's second BLA for AVT02, which contains data to support approval as a biosimilar and additional information supporting a potential interchangeability designation, has a Biosimilar User Fee Amendment (BsUFA) goal date of June 28, 2023. Satisfactory outcome of the facility reinspection remains the key requirement for approval of both BLAs. Alvotech has requested a meeting with the FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Assessment (OPMA) for clarification on the status of any potentially outstanding deficiencies noted in the recent inspection of the company's manufacturing facility.\n\nIn May 2023, a confirmatory patient study was initiated for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). The objective of the study is to demonstrate clinical similarity of AVT05 to Simponi® in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In 2022, combined net revenues worldwide from sales of Simponi® and Simponi Aria® were nearly U.S. $2.3 billion according to quarterly filings by the manufacturer of the reference products. Currently Alvotech is aware of only one other company that has initiated a study to support a biosimilar candidate for Simponi® and Simponi Aria®.\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech continued to strengthen the organization with the appointment of Sarah Tanksley to the Board of Directors of Alvotech hf., the operating entity for Alvotech's manufacturing site, and Sandra Casaca as the company's Chief Quality Officer, based on-site in Iceland. With over 25 years of experience, Sandra has held senior leadership positions in quality at leading companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie and Atara.\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided Biosana Pharma a notice of termination for the global licensing agreement between the two companies covering the co-development of AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair® (omalizumab).\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided an update on the company's Corporate Sustainability Framework that included new disclosures for 2022. The company has updated its Sustainability Portal, which provides data on the company's key environmental, social and governance indicators as well as other information related to sustainability. More information can be found at www.alvotech.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\nFinancial Results for First Three Months of 2023\n\nCash position and sources of liquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $115.8 million, excluding $25.2 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $793.7 million, including $23.0 million of current portion of borrowings, as of March 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue, including other income, was $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the same three months of 2022. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in certain European countries and Canada.\n\nCost of product revenue\n\nCost of product revenue was $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily a result of AVT02 product revenues in certain European countries and Canada. Cost of product revenue for the quarter is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period. The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in the greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $47.1 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $10.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03 and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022 and AVT05 that entered clinical development in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending of $13.8 million primarily related to programs for which the clinical activities were winding down. In addition, there was a reclassification of pre-commercial manufacturing activities of $12.4 million, that were previously recognized as R&D expense, which are now being recognized as cost of product revenue, in conjunction with the Company's commercial launch of AVT02.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses\n\nG&A expenses were $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $24.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $7.6 million in IP-related legal expenses and $2.0 million in transaction costs, which were incurred in 2022 in preparation for the business combination with Oaktree Acquisition Corp. II. This was partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in services related to Alvotech's public listing in both the U.S. and Iceland and expenses associated with the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\nFinance income\n\nFinance income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 thousand for the same three months of 2022. This was primarily attributable to interests received on bank accounts resulting from higher cash balances and favorable interest rate environment versus the same period in the prior year.\n\nFinance costs\n\nFinance costs were $207.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.9 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences\n\nExchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate to financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotech's website in the Investors Section of the Company's website under https://investors.alvotech.com \"News and Events - Events and Presentations\", where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotech's Investor Relations website under News and Events - Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab)\n\nAVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to Humira® (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

            "body": "REYKJAVIK, Iceland, May 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alvotech ALVO or the \"Company\"))), a global biotech company specializing in the development and manufacture of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide, today reported unaudited financial results for the first three months of 2023 and provided a summary of recent corporate highlights.\n\n\"It is with great pride that we have built a biosimilar-focused platform that now includes five biosimilar candidates that have reached in-patient studies, including AVT02 which is already marketed. I believe that we are well positioned to participate in the promise of global biosimilars for the long-term. And while we are a global company that has launched our first product in 17 markets around the world, we remain committed and focused to bringing AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to Humira, to patients in the United States, after regulatory approval,\" said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. \"We continue to work collaboratively with the FDA regarding both Biologic License Applications for AVT02 and are preparing for all possible scenarios, including resubmission of the first AVT02 BLA and hosting a possible reinspection of our manufacturing facility, which we would anticipate in 2023, if needed.\"\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech received from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a complete response letter (CRL) for the Company's Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02, a high-concentration biosimilar candidate for Humira (adalimumab). The CRL noted that certain deficiencies conveyed following the FDA's recent reinspection of the company's Reykjavik facility must be satisfactorily resolved before the application may be approved. Alvotech's second BLA for AVT02, which contains data to support approval as a biosimilar and additional information supporting a potential interchangeability designation, has a Biosimilar User Fee Amendment (BsUFA) goal date of June 28, 2023. Satisfactory outcome of the facility reinspection remains the key requirement for approval of both BLAs. Alvotech has requested a meeting with the FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Assessment (OPMA) for clarification on the status of any potentially outstanding deficiencies noted in the recent inspection of the company's manufacturing facility.\n\nIn May 2023, a confirmatory patient study was initiated for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi and Simponi Aria (golimumab). The objective of the study is to demonstrate clinical similarity of AVT05 to Simponi in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In 2022, combined net revenues worldwide from sales of Simponi and Simponi Aria were nearly U.S. $2.3 billion according to quarterly filings by the manufacturer of the reference products. Currently, Alvotech is aware of only one other company that has initiated a study to support a biosimilar candidate for Simponi and Simponi Aria.\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech continued to strengthen the organization with the appointment of Sarah Tanksley to the Board of Directors of Alvotech hf., the operating entity for Alvotech's manufacturing site, and Sandra Casaca as the company's Chief Quality Officer, based on-site in Iceland. With over 25 years of experience, Sandra has held senior leadership positions in quality at leading companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie and Atara.\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided Biosana Pharma a notice of termination for the global licensing agreement between the two companies covering the co-development of AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair (omalizumab).\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided an update on the company's Corporate Sustainability Framework that included new disclosures for 2022. The company has updated its Sustainability Portal, which provides data on the company's key environmental, social and governance indicators as well as other information related to sustainability. More information can be found at www.alvotech.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\nFinancial Results for First Three Months of 2023\n\nCash position and sources of liquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $115.8 million, excluding $25.2 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $793.7 million, including $23.0 million of current portion of borrowings, as of March 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue, including other income, was $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the same three months of 2022. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in certain European countries and Canada.\n\nCost of product revenue\n\nCost of product revenue was $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily a result of AVT02 product revenues in certain European countries and Canada. Cost of product revenue for the quarter is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period. The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in the greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $47.1 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $10.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03 and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022 and AVT05 that entered clinical development in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending of $13.8 million primarily related to programs for which the clinical activities were winding down. In addition, there was a reclassification of pre-commercial manufacturing activities of $12.4 million, that were previously recognized as R&D expense, which are now being recognized as cost of product revenue, in conjunction with the Company's commercial launch of AVT02.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses\n\nG&A expenses were $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $24.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $7.6 million in IP-related legal expenses and $2.0 million in transaction costs, which were incurred in 2022 in preparation for the business combination with Oaktree Acquisition Corp. II. This was partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in services related to Alvotech's public listing in both the U.S. and Iceland and expenses associated with the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\nFinance income\n\nFinance income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 thousand for the same three months of 2022. This was primarily attributable to interests received on bank accounts resulting from higher cash balances and favourable interest rate environment versus the same period in the prior year.\n\nFinance costs\n\nFinance costs were $207.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.9 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences\n\nExchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate to financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotech's website in the Investors Section of the Company's website under https://investors.alvotech.com \"News and Events - Events and Presentations\", where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotech's Investor Relations website under News and Events - Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab)\n\nAVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to Humira (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF). AVT02 has been approved in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, the UK and Switzerland (Hukyndra); Canada and Saudi Arabia (Simlandi); and Australia (Ciptunec and Aralicip). AVT02 dossiers are under review in multiple countries, including in the United States.\n\nAbout AVT04 (ustekinumab)\n\nAVT04 is a monoclonal antibody and a biosimilar candidate to Stelara (ustekinumab).

I believe that we are well positioned to participate in the promise of global biosimilars for the long-term. And while we are a global company that has launched our first product in 17 markets around the world, we remain committed and focused to bringing AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to Humira®, to patients in the United States, after regulatory approval,\" said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. \"We continue to work collaboratively with the FDA regarding both Biologic License Applications for AVT02 and are preparing for all possible scenarios, including resubmission of the first AVT02 BLA and hosting a possible reinspection of our manufacturing facility, which we would anticipate in 2023, if needed.\"\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech received from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a complete response letter (CRL) for the Company's Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02, a high-concentration biosimilar candidate for Humira® (adalimumab). The CRL noted that certain deficiencies conveyed following the FDA's recent reinspection of the company's Reykjavik facility must be satisfactorily resolved before the application may be approved. Alvotech's second BLA for AVT02, which contains data to support approval as a biosimilar and additional information supporting a potential interchangeability designation, has a Biosimilar User Fee Amendment (BsUFA) goal date of June 28, 2023. Satisfactory outcome of the facility reinspection remains the key requirement for approval of both BLAs. Alvotech has requested a meeting with the FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Assessment (OPMA) for clarification on the status of any potentially outstanding deficiencies noted in the recent inspection of the company's manufacturing facility.\n\nIn May 2023, a confirmatory patient study was initiated for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). The objective of the study is to demonstrate clinical similarity of AVT05 to Simponi® in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In 2022, combined net revenues worldwide from sales of Simponi® and Simponi Aria® were nearly U.S. $2.3 billion according to quarterly filings by the manufacturer of the reference products. Currently, Alvotech is aware of only one other company that has initiated a study to support a biosimilar candidate for Simponi® and Simponi Aria®.\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech continued to strengthen the organization with the appointment of Sarah Tanksley to the Board of Directors of Alvotech hf., the operating entity for Alvotech's manufacturing site, and Sandra Casaca as the company's Chief Quality Officer, based on-site in Iceland. With over 25 years of experience, Sandra has held senior leadership positions in quality at leading companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie and Atara.\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided Biosana Pharma a notice of termination for the global licensing agreement between the two companies covering the co-development of AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair® (omalizumab).\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided an update on the company's Corporate Sustainability Framework that included new disclosures for 2022. The company has updated its Sustainability Portal, which provides data on the company's key environmental, social and governance indicators as well as other information related to sustainability. More information can be found at www.alvotech.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\nFinancial Results for First Three Months of 2023\n\nCash position and sources of liquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $115.8 million, excluding $25.2 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $793.7 million, including $23.0 million of current portion of borrowings, as of March 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue, including other income, was $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the same three months of 2022. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in certain European countries and Canada.\n\nCost of product revenue\n\nCost of product revenue was $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily a result of AVT02 product revenues in certain European countries and Canada. Cost of product revenue for the quarter is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period. The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in the greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $47.1 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $10.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03 and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022 and AVT05 that entered clinical development in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending of $13.8 million primarily related to programs for which the clinical activities were winding down. In addition, there was a reclassification of pre-commercial manufacturing activities of $12.4 million, that were previously recognized as R&D expense, which are now being recognized as cost of product revenue, in conjunction with the Company's commercial launch of AVT02.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses\n\nG&A expenses were $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $24.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $7.6 million in IP-related legal expenses and $2.0 million in transaction costs, which were incurred in 2022 in preparation for the business combination with Oaktree Acquisition Corp. II. This was partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in services related to Alvotech's public listing in both the U.S. and Iceland and expenses associated with the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\nFinance income\n\nFinance income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 thousand for the same three months of 2022. This was primarily attributable to interests received on bank accounts resulting from higher cash balances and favourable interest rate environment versus the same period in the prior year.\n\nFinance costs\n\nFinance costs were $207.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.9 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences\n\nExchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate to financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotech's website in the Investors Section of the Company's website under https://investors.alvotech.com \"News and Events - Events and Presentations\", where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotech's Investor Relations website under News and Events - Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab)\n\nAVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to Humira® (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF). AVT02 has been approved in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, the UK and Switzerland (Hukyndra®); Canada and Saudi Arabia (Simlandi™); and Australia (Ciptunec™ and Aralicip™).

            "body": "Revenue for the first three months of 2023 increased to $15.9 million, compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2022Confirmatory patient study for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar for Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab) initiated, marking the fifth internally developed portfolio candidate to be dosed in a patient studySatisfactory outcome of facility reinspection remains the key requirement for U.S. approval of Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to Humira® (adalimumab)Management will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, 2023, at 8:00 am ET (13:00 pm GMT)\n\nAlvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO, or the \"Company\"), a global biotech company specializing in the development and manufacture of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide, today reported unaudited financial results for the first three months of 2023 and provided a summary of recent corporate highlights.\n\n\"It is with great pride that we have built a biosimilar-focused platform that now includes five biosimilar candidates that have reached in-patient studies, including AVT02 which is already marketed. I believe that we are well positioned to participate in the promise of global biosimilars for the long-term. And while we are a global company that has launched our first product in 17 markets around the world, we remain committed and focused to bringing AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to Humira®, to patients in the United States, after regulatory approval,\" said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. \"We continue to work collaboratively with the FDA regarding both Biologic License Applications for AVT02 and are preparing for all possible scenarios, including resubmission of the first AVT02 BLA and hosting a possible reinspection of our manufacturing facility, which we would anticipate in 2023, if needed.\"\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech received from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a complete response letter (CRL) for the Company's Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02, a high-concentration biosimilar candidate for Humira® (adalimumab). The CRL noted that certain deficiencies conveyed following the FDA's recent reinspection of the company's Reykjavik facility must be satisfactorily resolved before the application may be approved. Alvotech's second BLA for AVT02, which contains data to support approval as a biosimilar and additional information supporting a potential interchangeability designation, has a Biosimilar User Fee Amendment (BsUFA) goal date of June 28, 2023. Satisfactory outcome of the facility reinspection remains the key requirement for approval of both BLAs. Alvotech has requested a meeting with the FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Assessment (OPMA) for clarification on the status of any potentially outstanding deficiencies noted in the recent inspection of the company's manufacturing facility.\n\nIn May 2023, a confirmatory patient study was initiated for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). The objective of the study is to demonstrate clinical similarity of AVT05 to Simponi® in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In 2022, combined net revenues worldwide from sales of Simponi® and Simponi Aria® were nearly U.S. $2.3 billion according to quarterly filings by the manufacturer of the reference products. Currently Alvotech is aware of only one other company that has initiated a study to support a biosimilar candidate for Simponi® and Simponi Aria®.\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech continued to strengthen the organization with the appointment of Sarah Tanksley to the Board of Directors of Alvotech hf., the operating entity for Alvotech's manufacturing site, and Sandra Casaca as the company's Chief Quality Officer, based on-site in Iceland. With over 25 years of experience, Sandra has held senior leadership positions in quality at leading companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie and Atara.\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided Biosana Pharma a notice of termination for the global licensing agreement between the two companies covering the co-development of AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair® (omalizumab).\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided an update on the company's Corporate Sustainability Framework that included new disclosures for 2022. The company has updated its Sustainability Portal, which provides data on the company's key environmental, social and governance indicators as well as other information related to sustainability. More information can be found at www.alvotech.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\nFinancial Results for First Three Months of 2023\n\nCash position and sources of liquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $115.8 million, excluding $25.2 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $793.7 million, including $23.0 million of current portion of borrowings, as of March 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue, including other income, was $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the same three months of 2022. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in certain European countries and Canada.\n\nCost of product revenue\n\nCost of product revenue was $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily a result of AVT02 product revenues in certain European countries and Canada. Cost of product revenue for the quarter is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period. The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in the greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $47.1 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $10.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03 and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022 and AVT05 that entered clinical development in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending of $13.8 million primarily related to programs for which the clinical activities were winding down. In addition, there was a reclassification of pre-commercial manufacturing activities of $12.4 million, that were previously recognized as R&D expense, which are now being recognized as cost of product revenue, in conjunction with the Company's commercial launch of AVT02.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses\n\nG&A expenses were $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $24.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $7.6 million in IP-related legal expenses and $2.0 million in transaction costs, which were incurred in 2022 in preparation for the business combination with Oaktree Acquisition Corp. II. This was partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in services related to Alvotech's public listing in both the U.S. and Iceland and expenses associated with the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\nFinance income\n\nFinance income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 thousand for the same three months of 2022. This was primarily attributable to interests received on bank accounts resulting from higher cash balances and favorable interest rate environment versus the same period in the prior year.\n\nFinance costs\n\nFinance costs were $207.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.9 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences\n\nExchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate to financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotech's website in the Investors Section of the Company's website under https://investors.alvotech.com \"News and Events - Events and Presentations\", where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotech's Investor Relations website under News and Events - Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab)\n\nAVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to Humira® (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF). AVT02 has been approved in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, the UK and Switzerland (Hukyndra®); Canada and Saudi Arabia (Simlandi™); and Australia (Ciptunec™ and Aralicip™). AVT02 dossiers are under review in multiple countries, including in the United States.\n\nAbout AVT04 (ustekinumab)\n\nAVT04 is a monoclonal antibody and a biosimilar candidate to Stelara® (ustekinumab).

AVT03 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimiliarity is not claimed.\n\nAbout AVT05 (golimumab)\n\nAVT05 is a biosimilar candidate for Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). Golimumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a cytokine protein in the body. Elevated TNF alpha levels have been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. AVT05 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity is not claimed.\n\nAbout AVT06\n\nAVT06 is a recombinant fusion protein and a biosimilar candidate to Eylea® (aflibercept), which binds vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), inhibiting the binding and activation of VEGF receptors, neovascularization, and vascular permeability. AVT06 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity is not claimed.\n\nAbout AVT23\n\nAVT23 is a proposed biosimilar to to Xolair ® (omalizumab).

            "body": "Alvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO, or the âCompanyâ), a global biotech company specializing in the development and manufacture of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide, today reported unaudited financial results for the first three months of 2023 and provided a summary of recent corporate highlights.\n\n\"It is with great pride that we have built a biosimilar-focused platform that now includes five biosimilar candidates that have reached in-patient studies, including AVT02 which is already marketed. I believe that we are well positioned to participate in the promise of global biosimilars for the long-term.Â And while we are a global company that has launched our first product in 17 markets around the world, we remain committed and focused to bringing AVT02, a proposed high-concentration, interchangeable biosimilar to HumiraÂ®, to patients in the United States, after regulatory approval,â said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. âWe continue to work collaboratively with the FDA regarding both Biologic License Applications for AVT02 and are preparing for all possible scenarios, including resubmission of the first AVT02 BLA and hosting a possible reinspection of our manufacturing facility, which we would anticipate in 2023, if needed.â\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech received from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a complete response letter (CRL) for the Companyâs Biologics License Application (BLA) for AVT02, a high-concentration biosimilar candidate for Humira (adalimumab).Â The CRL noted that certain deficiencies conveyed following the FDAâs recent reinspection of the companyâs Reykjavik facility must be satisfactorily resolved before the application may be approved.Â Alvotechâs second BLA for AVT02, which contains data to support approval as a biosimilar and additional information supporting a potential interchangeability designation, has a Biosimilar User Fee Amendment (BsUFA) goal date of June 28, 2023. Satisfactory outcome of the facility reinspection remains the key requirement for approval of both BLAs.Â Alvotech has requested a meeting with the FDAâs Office of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Assessment (OPMA) for clarification on the status of any potentially outstanding deficiencies noted in the recent inspection of the companyâs manufacturing facility.\n\nIn May 2023, a confirmatory patient study was initiated for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi and Simponi Aria (golimumab).Â The objective of the study is to demonstrate clinical similarity of AVT05 to Simponi in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Â In 2022, combined net revenues worldwide from sales of Simponi and Simponi Aria were nearly U.S. $2.3 billion according to quarterly filings by the manufacturer of the reference products.Â Currently Alvotech is aware of only one other company that has initiated a study to support a biosimilar candidate for Simponi and Simponi Aria.\n\nIn April 2023, Alvotech continued to strengthen the organization with the appointment of Sarah Tanksley to the Board of Directors of Alvotech hf., the operating entity for Alvotechâs manufacturing site, and Sandra Casaca as the companyâs Chief Quality Officer, based on-site in Iceland.Â With over 25 years of experience, Sandra has held senior leadership positions in quality at leading companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie and Atara.\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided Biosana Pharma a notice of termination for the global licensing agreement between the two companies covering the co-development of AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair (omalizumab).Â\n\nIn March 2023, Alvotech provided an update on the companyâs Corporate Sustainability Framework that included new disclosures for 2022.Â The company has updated its Sustainability Portal, which provides data on the companyâs key environmental, social and governance indicators as well as other information related to sustainability.Â More information can be found at www.alvotech.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\nFinancial Results for First Three Months of 2023\n\nCash position and sources of liquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $115.8 million, excluding $25.2 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $793.7 million, including $23.0 million of current portion of borrowings, as of March 31, 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue, including other income, was $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the same three months of 2022. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in certain European countries and Canada.\n\nCost of product revenue\n\nCost of product revenue was $39.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily a result of AVT02 product revenues in certain European countries and Canada. Cost of product revenue for the quarter is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period.Â The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in the greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs.Â Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $47.1 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $10.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03 Â and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022 and AVT05 that entered clinical development in 2023.Â These increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending of $13.8 million primarily related to programs for which the clinical activities were winding down. In addition, there was a reclassification of pre-commercial manufacturing activities of $12.4 million, that were previously recognized as R&D expense, which are now being recognized as cost of product revenue, in conjunction with the Companyâs commercial launch of AVT02.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses\n\nG&A expenses were $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $24.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $7.6 million in IP-related legal expenses and $2.0 million in transaction costs, which were incurred in 2022 in preparation for the business combination with Oaktree Acquisition Corp. II.Â This was partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in services related to Alvotechâs public listing in both the U.S. and Iceland and expenses associated with the companyâs long-term incentive plan.Â\n\nFinance income\n\nFinance income was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $4 thousand for the same three months of 2022. This was primarily attributable to interests received on bank accounts resulting from higher cash balances and favorable interest rate environment versus the same period in the prior year.\n\nFinance costs\n\nFinance costs were $207.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.9 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences\n\nExchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate toÂ financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotechâs website in the Investors Section of the Companyâs website under https://investors.alvotech.com âNews and Events â\" Events and Presentationsâ, where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotechâs Investor Relations website under News and Events â\" Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab)\n\nAVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to Humira (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

The increase was primarily attributable to a $179 million non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nExchange rate differences Exchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the exchange rate toÂ financial assets and liabilities denominated in Icelandic Krona and Euros, along with the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona compared to the US Dollar over the current period.\n\nIncome tax benefit Income tax benefit was $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million for the same three months of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net operating losses, which Alvotech expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits, and a foreign currency benefit of $6.3 million due to strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.S. dollar value of tax loss carry-forwards expected to be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nNet Loss Net loss was 276.2 million, or ($1.24) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net loss of $77.1 million, or ($0.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same three months of 2022.\n\nBusiness Update Conference Call\n\nAlvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Friday, May 19, at 8:00 am ET (12:00 noon GMT).\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Alvotechâs website in the Investors Section of the Companyâs website under https://investors.alvotech.com âNews and Events â\" Events and Presentationsâ, where you will also be able to find a replay of the webcast, following the call for 90 days.\n\nIn order to participate in the conference call, please register in advance using the link on Alvotechâs Investor Relations website under News and Events â\" Events and Presentations, to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nAbout AVT02 (adalimumab) AVT02 is a monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated for biosimilarity and interchangeability to HumiraÂ® (adalimumab), which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

The move is expected to provide millions of people with access to the drug in a region that the World Health Organization (WHO) says accounts for almost two-thirds of new HIV infections globally.\n\nThe drug, cabotegravir long-acting (LA), will be produced by Cipla Limited, an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company, at its plants in Benoni or Durban, The Guardian reported on Thursday.\n\nRead more: Addressing the HIV outbreak in Pakistan\n\nLast year, the WHO described CAB-LA as a \"safe and highly effective prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection.\" The drug is said to block HIV from entering cells, massively reducing the risk of infection, and has been proven by research to reduce the chances of contracting the virus through sex.\n\nThe developers of the drug, Viiv Healthcare and the United Nations-backed public health organization Medicines Patent Pool, said sublicense agreements to produce the generic version were signed with Aurobindo, Cipla, and Viatris in March.\n\nIn a statement on its website at the time, the MPP said the selected manufacturers will be able to develop and supply generic versions in 90 countries \"subject to required regulatory approvals being obtained.\"\n\nThe drug is provided as an injection administered six times per year and is initiated with a single 600mg (3ml) jab given one month apart for two consecutive months, according to the MPP. However, a person must have a negative HIV-1 test prior to receiving it.\n\nRead more: Sindh govt's negligence led to HIV outbreak in Larkana\n\nIn South Africa, ViiV Healthcare holds the patent for CAB-LA until 2031, limiting competition. Viiv also announced that it has received regulatory approval for use of the drug in the United States, Australia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Malawi for at-risk adults and adolescents.",

            "body": "The Munga, known as the toughest race on earth, and GivenGain, a leading online fundraising platform, have joined forces to inspire participants to make a positive impact while taking on the ultimate endurance challenge. GivenGain, which has partnered with various international and local mountain bike events like the Epic Series, enables riders to easily create custom fundraising projects for charities of their choice, making it simple for them to raise funds and support causes they care about.\n\nThe Munga, a gruelling 1000 km semi-supported race, has seen 14 riders raise over R400K on GivenGain since 2015 for 13 different charities, with donors from 16 countries and participants from 4 countries including the USA, Belgium, England, and South Africa. This year, Nika Capital, a non-profit organisation dedicated to funding allocations to selected schools, NPOs, and NGOs that share the mission of educating children and building them as valuable individuals and leaders, aims to raise more than R1 Million through their group of 20 dedicated riders (and their networks). However, The Munga is an open event, and participants can fundraise for any charity they choose.\n\n\"At The Munga, we celebrate what it is to be human. We know the daily fight. We know what it's like to hang on to a thread, but claw and pull it back till it's a tightrope, and walk that thin line, balancing the life and death of dreams, till at last we lean forward, and the momentum of action carries us inexorably towards our destiny! At The Munga, we know what it's like to live, but really live!\" says event organiser Alex Harris.\n\nThe Munga Grit Tankwa, The Munga Grit Cradle, The Munga Grit USA, The Munga MTB, and The Munga Equipe are some of the upcoming events in the series, taking place from April to December this year. While fundraising is not yet in full swing, two fundraisers have already set up projects on GivenGain, all in support of Nika Capital. More participants are expected to start joining throughout the year.\n\nA standout fundraiser from 2022 provides inspiration for this year's riders to aim high: Last year, participant Jaco Coetzee successfully raised R66,140 for the Cipla Foundation's Miles For Smiles charity.\n\n\"Knowing that every kilometre I pedal has an impact on others is a great motivator to keep going with training as well as during the race. There are so many people going through so much tougher things in life than a long cycle journey, and this really just gave so much more meaning through my whole Munga journey,\" said Jaco, when asked about how the fundraising aspect played into his training and The Munga ride itself.\n\nGivenGain has been a trusted fundraising platform for events like the Cape Town Cycle Tour and ABSA Cape Epic for several years, helping cyclists raise over R13.3 million for more than 500 charities. Through GivenGain's intuitive online platform, participants can easily create and share their custom fundraising projects, directly linked to registered charities, with their personal networks. This has made a meaningful difference in the lives of many, supporting South African charities during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n\"We are proud to partner with The Munga and GivenGain to empower participants to ride for good and make a positive impact on the causes they care about. The combination of the ultimate endurance challenge of The Munga and the user-friendly online fundraising platform of GivenGain provides a unique opportunity for participants to go beyond their personal limits and contribute to the greater good,\" says Thinus Redelinghuys, Fundraiser from Nika Capital.\n\nJoin The Munga and GivenGain in the mission to empower participants to ride for good and make a positive impact on their communities.

            "body": "Equity mutual funds have emerged as big players in the Indian stock market. With investors pumping thousands of crores each month through lumpsum and SIP investments, how have MFs churned their portfolios? Below are 6 infographics that provide insights into what happened on the equity MF arena in April 2023. Take a look at 10 most stocks bought, 10 most stocks sold, most popular stocks, new stock entries, complete stock exits, sector-wise stock holdings and foreign equity holders among AMCs.\n\nMost bought and sold\n\nIn April, mutual funds added holdings in over 350 stocks. These transactions depend on the fund managers' view, inflows and fund mandate, among other factors. The top 10 most bought stocks (as per buy value) include the likes of Infosys, RHI Magnesita, NTPC, FSN E-commerce, HUL, Cipla, Crompton Greaves Consumer, RIL etc.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the most sold stocks in April-2023 had major banking names such as Axis Bank, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank. Others in this list include Max Healthcare Institute, M&M, ITC, ONGC etc.\n\nBe it the buying and selling list, large-caps dominate. The presence of large-caps is not usual as a large part of total equity MF AUM is present in large-caps.\n\nMost popular stocks\n\nFrom a most-owned stock perspective, giants of financial services, energy, IT, industrials, telecom, FMCG typically dominate the top half of the list. So, ICICI Bank, based on MF market value and percentage of equity AUM, is the most-owned, followed by HDFC Bank, RIL, Infosys, HDFC, SBI, Axis Bank, L&T, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS and Bajaj Finance.\n\nNext in the list are NTPC, Sun Pharma, Maruti, HUL, HCL Tech., M&M, Ultratech, ONGC, Avenue Supermarts, BEL and PGCIL.\n\nStocks that entered, exited MF folios\n\nTypically, attractive IPOs or recently listed stocks often make into the list of stocks that find new place in MF portfolios. In April, we saw shares worth over ₹500 crore of Mankind Pharma finding their way into equity MF portfolios. Other new entries were Cube Highways, Avalon Technologies, and Speciality Restaurants.\n\nIn the same vein, investors often track stocks that are exited completely by mutual funds. In April, the overall fund industry sold off and reported nil investments in CPCL, Mirza International, Tasty Bite Eatables and Kamdhenu Ventures. Complete exits could be due to various reasons such as non-inclusion in indices, fundamental reasons, other attractive opportunities in the same space taking precedence, alteration of fund manager view on a sector, change in investment style etc.\n\nSectoral composition, foreign equity holders\n\nLet us take a look at how the equity AUM of Indian MF industry looks through the lens of sectors. Like the broader indices, banks/financial services occupy the biggest weight if one were to look the most-preferred sectors of MF stock holdings. They are followed by consumer discretionary, industrials, IT, commodities, energy, healthcare sectors. Small changes in sectoral exposure could be due to market-linked movements. But over time, often one can see how mutual funds have pared or ramped up exposure to one sector vis-a-vis the other.\n\nForeign stocks have increasingly captured the imagination of Indian investors. Here's a look at which AMCs are the big players in foreign equity holdings. Broadly, Motilal Oswal, ICICI Prudential, PPFAS, SBI and Axis fund-houses are dominant holders of foreign equity. In April, the noticeable change of holding happened in ICICI Prudential, followed by PPFAS and SBI.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 18, 2023",

            "body": "Indian drug company to make cheaper generic version of CAB-LA, potentially protecting millions of people in Africa from the virus\n\nAn affordable version of a groundbreaking HIV-prevention drug will be made in South Africa for the first time, potentially giving millions of people at risk of HIV infection in Africa access to a two-monthly jab that can almost eliminate their chances of contracting the virus.\n\nThe Indian drug company Cipla confirmed that a generic version of the prophylaxis, long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA), would be manufactured at its plants in Benoni, near Johannesburg, or Durban.\n\nCabotegravir blocks HIV from entering a person's cells. Studies have shown that it reduces to almost zero an individual's chances of getting infected with the virus through sex. As it is easier to take regularly, CAB-LA has also been found to work better than a daily HIV-prevention pill, which is available for free in South Africa and several other African countries.\n\nThe confirmation follows an announcement in March that the developers of CAB-LA, ViiV Healthcare, and the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), had granted licences to three companies, including Cipla.\n\nThe other two companies, Aurobindo and Viatris, are also Indian corporations that are already producing antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment.\n\nThe branded version of CAB-LA sells for about $3,500 (£2,800) for one injection in the US - a price that puts it out of reach for lower-income countries. Even at a lower, \"not-for-profit\" price at which the manufacturer said it would sell the medicine to 90 poorer countries, including South Africa, the brand-name version is probably too expensive for the South African government to buy.\n\nLast year, celebrities and leading figures in healthcare, including Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids, called for ViiV to lower the price of the drug. But being granted a licence to produce a generic version of a branded medicine is only the first step.\n\n\"CAB-LA is a sterile, injectable product with a very complex manufacturing process,\" Kimberly Smith, ViiV's head of research, told Bhekisisa, a health news site, last year. For a pharmaceutical company to make a generic version of the medicine, the technology behind the manufacturing must be shared, so it could take up to five years before the product is on the market.\n\nViiV holds the patent for CAB-LA until 2031 in South Africa, which means that unless licences were granted for other generics, the company would have no competition for at least eight years.\n\nEven one new contender can dramatically affect medicine prices, according to an analysis by the Food and Drug Administration, the US medicines regulator. It estimated that one generic manufacturer entering the market cut the price wholesalers paid manufacturers for a drug by 39%. Products with six or more generic producers were on average 95% cheaper than when only a single branded option was available, the report found.\n\nLess than 40% of the medicines Africa needs can be made on the continent, and only 38 countries are estimated to have any drug manufacturers. Where they do exist, the companies rarely make medicines from scratch.\n\nWhen ready-made and packaged medicines are imported, they can be expensive and it is significantly cheaper to import the raw materials to make the medicine locally, according to an analysis by the consultancy McKinsey.\n\nIntellectual property deals such as the one brokered by the MPP can also lessen the impact of medicine shortages because alternative suppliers are available. Poorer countries suffer without such an agreement, as they did during the Covid pandemic, when the west bought up most of the stock of vaccines.\n\nBy the time Africa had enough doses to vaccinate about 9% of the continent's population in early 2021, Canada had paid for enough jabs to vaccinate its population five times over.\n\nIn 2020 India and South Africa led a campaign at the World Trade Organization for intellectual property rights to be waived on Covid vaccines, medicines and tests, proposing that pharmaceutical companies should explain how to make the drugs, as well as what was in it.\n\nIn June 2022, a watered-down version of the proposal was accepted, but it only covered vaccines until 2027 and not medicines, treatments or tests. And it only applied to patents, not technology transfers, so generics firms would only know the ingredients and not the manufacturing process.\n\nLicensing generics did not remove the risk of drug shortages, said Esteban Burrone, MPP's head of policy, explaining that the lower profit margins could deter manufacturers from producing generics.\n\nFor this reason, pharmaceutical companies seeking a sub-licence must agree to create \"broad access\" once awarded manufacturing rights. For CAB-LA, Burrone said they \"zoomed in on the three manufacturers who are most ready\" to address demand rapidly.",

            "body": "Chronic therapy brands never die, they keep increasing in scale and size, said Cipla's MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra, explaining the rationale behind its agreement with Novartis on diabetes therapy Galvus.\n\nLast month, Cipla had inked a perpetual license agreement with Novartis, as part of its strategy to grow the One India franchise towards a higher share of chronic therapies. Galvus and its combination brands had clocked sales of ₹270 crore, upto March 2023, and would strengthen the company's diabetes portfolio, Vohra told analysts recently, outlining Cipla's push in the diabetes segment, besides its strategies in key markets like India, South Africa, and the United States.\n\nFurther on the Galvus agreement, he said, \"This is a relatively large brand in the diabetes segment and Cipla has historically always been a big respiratory player but not that big in the diabetes area.\" In December 2019, Cipla had acquired the brand name and trademark rights for Vysov and Vysov M (Vildagliptin + Metformin) of the anti-diabetic drug, Vildagliptin for the Indian market. The company had been co-marketing Vildagliptin in agreement with Novartis under brand names, Vysov and Vysov M.\n\nAlso read: Cipla's Q4 profit grows 45% to ₹536 crore\n\nCipla also entered into an alliance to market and distribute Scapho, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of psoriasis. And under Cipla Health, the company acquired Endura MASS, a nutritional supplement. The company has invested in growing its field force by 800 people in the last two years, besides investing in research, including the initiation of trials in complex products, he said. \"We have three differentiated products undergoing clinical trials with filings targeted in FY24,\" he added.\n\nDerisking for the US\n\nThe company has also been on the path to derisk its portfolio in the United States. \"Our US supply continues to be well diversified across all our sites and partner sites...,\" Vohra said. On regulatory compliance, he added, the audit had been completed at its Fall River, Massachusetts sites, with zero '483 observations. \"We have the approval to produce our respiratory assets in this facility. Respiratory assets are being derisked to this in-house facility,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he added, \"For Indore, we expect classification by mid-May. However, we do not see any risk to commercialise product portfolio. Generic Advair is already being derisked to another in-house facility. Remediation efforts are ongoing for our Goa facility, and we expect a CAPA (corrective and preventive actions) completion by the end of Q1.\"\n\nAlso read: Cipla invests in Germany's Ethris for mRNA-based therapies\n\nHe also added, \"Reinspection is required for plant clearance, which is being targeted for Q3. Our generic Advair file is now solely dependent on the facility approval, having cleared all other questions from the agency. We have already commenced the derisking process for this product, ... to our other in-house facility. The value stays intact as no new generic is expected before we launch.\"\n\nOn nano-paclitaxel (generic Abraxane), he added, \"We expect to be able to supply from two sites by FY25. We don't see any change to the value of this product and there are clearly no generic launches till date.\"\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 17, 2023",

            "body": "© Provided by Healthcare Asia\n\nMedtech was a major catalyst for Japanese stocks while the booming plasma industry bodes well for Australia.\n\nAsia Pacific's healthcare-related stocks ended mixed in April as major players in Australia, Japan and India outperformed while Chinese stocks underwhelmed, according to a research note by investment banking firm Jefferies.\n\nJefferies said Japanese healthcare-related stocks, through the Tokyo Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical (TOPIX Pharma) subindex, traded in line with the broader TOPIX index in April but certain players outperformed, boosted by medical technology.\n\nBiotech firm Sosei emerged as the best performer last month as it beat TOPIX by 18%, followed by medical device specialist Terumo and pharma group Otsuka.\n\n\"Japan Medtech was generally strong in April, outperforming TOPIX by 1.7%. Last-year's headwinds have ameliorated, and we think that Medtech will continue to perform well,\" the note published on 8 May read.\n\nIn the Australian bourse, Jefferies said biotech behemoth CSL led the gains on the back of a bright outlook for the plasma industry globally.\n\n\"We believe the plasma industry is underpenetrated and rational. The plasma industry can continue to grow strongly despite ongoing competitive threats,\" it said.\n\nMajor drugmakers Cipla and Alkem were the growth drivers in the Indian healthcare sector last month as local players are expected to benefit from a strong flu season. Jefferies also expects increased sales for Indian companies in the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) market while hospital stocks may see occupancy rates rise in the coming quarter.\n\nWhile healthcare stocks rose in major Asia Pacific markets, the overall Chinese stock market lagged on subdued performance of the companies. Nonetheless, Jefferies still expects certain players like pharma chain operator Yifeng Pharmacy to see robust growth this year.\n\n\"Yifeng remains one of our top picks in the subsector on its high growth and efficiency profile,\" it said.\n\nRead more",

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices opened lower on Wednesday as investors looked to book profits after a strong rally over the past few days. Weaker global cues in the wake of the ongoing US debt ceiling crisis have also made investors nervous.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex was down 96.44 points to 61,386.03 at around 9:37 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 26.45 points to 18,260.05. Broader market indices were mostly mixed, with a positive bias.\n\nMost of the major sectoral indices were trading in negative territory, but the losses were limited in early trade. Nifty Financial Services, Nifty IT, Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty were the top drags among sectoral indices.\n\nAlso Read | Sensex, Nifty fall after late selling in choppy session; financials slump\n\nThe top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were BPCL, Hero MotoCorp, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto and Cipla. On the other hand, HDFC Life, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, Infosys and Tata Consumer Products were the top losers.\n\nGoing forward, analysts expect the domestic markets to see further correction due to profit booking. While foreign institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 1,406.86 crore, domestic institutional investors sold share worth Rs 886.17 crore on May 16, showed provisional data from the NSE.\n\n\"The charts indicate that the Nifty may get support at 18,220, followed by 18,175 and 18,150. If the index advances, 18,350 would be the initial key resistance level to watch out for, followed by 18,400 and 18,450,\" said Deven Mehata, research analyst at Choice Broking.\n\n\"The market's drop yesterday can be interpreted as profit taking or a running correction. On a closing basis, the positional perspective remains buy on dips with a stop loss of 18200. If the Nifty closes below 18200 and the Bank Nifty closes below 43200, the market would likely correct further,\" he added.",

            "body": "Mumbai : IRM India Affiliate has entered into a knowledge partnership by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to build resilience and promote the need for and importance of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in the telecoms industry. IRM is the world's leading professional body for ERM qualifications across 140+ countries and Reliance Jio is an Indian telecommunications company, and a subsidiary of Jio Platforms that operates a national LTE network with coverage across all 22 telecom circles.\n\nReliance Jio, the leader in the telecoms sector, has been holding the lion's share of the market with portfolio of products and services. As a part of this knowledge partnership, both IRM India Affiliate and Reliance Jio will be organising webinars, roundtables, industry meetings, and contributing thought leadership articles towards knowledge building and to enhance ERM and risk intelligence for the sector.\n\nSpeaking about the collaboration, Mr. Sachin Mutha, Head of Risk Management, Reliance Jio said: \"We are excited to partner with the world's leading professional body for ERM exams and education. Our risk management process and practices are on par with international standards and together with IRM, we are excited to drive global thought leadership.\"\n\nOn this collaboration, Mr. Rajneesh Jain, Chief Financial Officer, Reliance Jio said: \"We've already developed a robust risk culture that fosters risk-based decision-making across all functions in the organisation. Our association with IRM is timely and we hope to set a global benchmark and drive best practices in enterprise risk management.\"\n\nThe collaboration is part of IRM India Affiliate's mission of developing a robust ecosystem of risk-intelligent organisations across sectors with an aim to build a resilient and self-reliant India. IRM has recently entered into knowledge partnership with leading organisations including: Cipla, UltraTech, IHCL, NIMSME (Ministry of MSME), AICTE (Ministry of Education) and more. IRM India Affiliate has also recently welcomed representatives from international bodies like ISO and COSO as external Board Advisors.\n\nElaborating on the collaboration with Reliance Jio, Hersh Shah, CEO, IRM India Affiliate, said: \"This knowledge partnership is a milestone for telecoms as it will help drive the importance of a robust risk culture in the sector, through sharing of best enterprise risk practices across platforms. Our global philosophy is well aligned with Jio's long-term strategy towards excellence in ERM.\"\n\nThe landscape of risks in the telecoms industry has expanded significantly and made risk management increasingly challenging and resource intensive for telecoms says a recent study by KPMG.\n\nThe key risk areas identified were either related to investment, employees, supply chain, regulatory, and cyber risk. The COVID pandemic has demonstrated the importance of having a robust, scalable, and secure telecommunications network for the economic wellbeing of nations and its citizens.",

            "body": "Embattled billionaire Gautam Adani's flagship entity Adani Enterprises saw the highest month-on-month buying at 16.8% with Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, Invesco and NJ Mutual Fund. Latest data from Motilal Oswal shows that at least 17 mutual funds hold exposure in the multibagger Nifty stock that is up over 1200% in the last 3 years.\n\nAdani Ports also saw fund managers MF holdings inching higher by 2.6% month-on-month in April.\n\nOther Nifty stocks that saw highest buying include Cipla, Tata Motors, HUL, Infosys, NTPC, Tata Consumer and Bajaj Finance.\n\nAmong other Adani stocks, the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate's FMCG arm Adani Wilmar saw the entry of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, LIC Mutual Fund and Sundaram. Even after a 32% correction in the last one year, the stock is still trading at an expensive valuation of around 86 times PE.\n\nShares of Adani Total Gas, which have lost 67% in the last one year, saw the exit of Nippon India Mutual Fund.\n\nThe group's cement arm ACC saw the exit of Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund and ITI while JM Financial and Franklin Templeton were seen on the buying side. In the case of Ambuja Cements, Invesco and Baroda BNP Paribas showed buying interest.What should investors do?\n\nWhile the chances of the pressure on Adani stocks lifting anytime soon till the regulatory overhang gets over are bleak, financials are turning out to be top favourites.\n\nApril saw mutual funds raising weights of NBFCs, automobiles, capital goods, PSU banks, telecom, and infrastructure, while moderating the weights of technology, healthcare, cement, retail, and insurance.\n\n\"We like private sector banks like Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank. Most of them are trading near their 5- or 10-year lowest price-to-book ratio levels despite the recent rally. We believe private banks offer an excellent value buying opportunity at this stage,\" said Apurva Sheth of SAMCO Securities.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities' Sanjeev Prasad agrees saying financials remain reasonably valued and appear attractive in the context of a likely healthy credit cycle over the next 1-2 years.\n\n\"Most growth stocks, especially in consumption, investment and outsourcing space, are trading at expensive valuations, despite increasing near-term demand issues and medium-term disruption risk,\" he said.\n\nMarch quarter shareholding pattern of BSE500 companies shows that FIIs are geared into a cyclical upturn with an overweight stance on financials, industrials and property being further strengthened. \" IT is now the biggest underweight sector for FIIs, though domestic MF positioning is closer to neutral. Common underweight position in our preferred sector is in consumer staples; partly explaining the catch-up rally since early April,\" Jefferies said.\n\nOn the back of over Rs 25,000 crore buying by FIIs so far in the month of April, Nifty has been on a gaining spree and has rallied over 3% in the last one month.",

            "body": "NEW DELHI: Unperturbed by the ongoing investigation by a Supreme Court appointed committee and market regulator Sebi on the Hindenburg issue, mutual funds were seen buying stakes of several Adani Group companies in May.\n\nEmbattled billionaire Gautam Adani's flagship entity Adani Enterprises saw the highest month-on-month buying at 16.8% with Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, Invesco and NJ Mutual Fund. Latest data from Motilal Oswal shows that at least 17 mutual funds hold exposure in the multibagger Nifty stock that is up over 1200% in the last 3 years.\n\nAdani Ports also saw fund managers MF holdings inching higher by 2.6% month-on-month in April.\n\nOther Nifty stocks that saw highest buying include Cipla, Tata Motors, HUL, Infosys, NTPC, Tata Consumer and Bajaj Finance.\n\nAmong other Adani stocks, the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate's FMCG arm Adani Wilmar saw the entry of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, LIC Mutual Fund and Sundaram. Even after a 32% correction in the last one year, the stock is still trading at an expensive valuation of around 86 times PE.\n\nShares of Adani Total Gas, which have lost 67% in the last one year, saw the exit of Nippon India Mutual Fund.\n\nThe group's cement arm ACC saw the exit of Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund and ITI while JM Financial and Franklin Templeton were seen on the buying side. In the case of Ambuja Cements, Invesco and Baroda BNP Paribas showed buying interest.\n\nWhat should investors do?\n\nWhile the chances of the pressure on Adani stocks lifting anytime soon till the regulatory overhang gets over are bleak, financials are turning out to be top favourites.\n\nApril saw mutual funds raising weights of NBFCs, automobiles, capital goods, PSU banks, telecom, and infrastructure, while moderating the weights of technology, healthcare, cement, retail, and insurance.\n\n\"We like private sector banks like Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank. Most of them are trading near their 5- or 10-year lowest price-to-book ratio levels despite the recent rally. We believe private banks offer an excellent value buying opportunity at this stage,\" said Apurva Sheth of SAMCO Securities.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities' Sanjeev Prasad agrees saying financials remain reasonably valued and appear attractive in the context of a likely healthy credit cycle over the next 1-2 years.\n\n\"Most growth stocks, especially in consumption, investment and outsourcing space, are trading at expensive valuations, despite increasing near-term demand issues and medium-term disruption risk,\" he said.\n\nMarch quarter shareholding pattern of BSE500 companies shows that FIIs are geared into a cyclical upturn with an overweight stance on financials, industrials and property being further strengthened. \" IT is now the biggest underweight sector for FIIs, though domestic MF positioning is closer to neutral. Common underweight position in our preferred sector is in consumer staples; partly explaining the catch-up rally since early April,\" Jefferies said.\n\nOn the back of over Rs 25,000 crore buying by FIIs so far in the month of April, Nifty has been on a gaining spree and has rallied over 3% in the last one month.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "title": "Indian Stocks Start Fresh Week On A Firm Note",
            "body": "Indian stock indices started the fresh week on a firm note with support from a range of fundamentals such as continued inflow of foreign funds, easing in inflation (both retail and wholesale), and global cues.\n\nBenchmark indices Sensex and Nifty closed Monday's trade up 0.5 per cent each. Hero Motocorp, Tata Motors, ITC, Tech Mahindra, and Hindalco were the top five gainers, whereas Adani Enterprises, Cipla, BPCL, Grasim Industries, and Divis Labs were the top five losers.\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) have continued to remain net buyers in Indian stock markets for the third straight month after having sold two months on a trot in January and February, data from the National Securities Depository (NSDL) revealed.\n\nFPIs bought assets worth Rs 11,631 crore in Indian stock markets in April, according to NSDL data. In March, they bought assets worth about Rs 7,936 crore in Indian stock markets.\n\nSo far in May, they bought assets worth Rs 24,739 crore.\n\n\"Markets started the week on a firm note and gained nearly half a per cent amid mixed cues. After the flat start, the Nifty index inched gradually higher as the day progressed, however, profit-taking in the final hour trimmed the gains,\" said Ajit Mishra, VP - of Technical Research, Religare Broking.\n\n\"The rotational buying in heavyweights from the key sectors viz., banking, financial, auto and FMCG is helping the index to maintain a positive tone despite mixed global cues. And, indications are in favour of the prevailing trend continuing. Traders should align their positions accordingly and avoid contrarian trades.\"\n\nComing to wholesale inflation whose data was released today, it turned negative in April at minus 0.92 per cent, happening for the first time since July 2020. Overall wholesale inflation was at 8.39 in October and has been falling since then. Notably, the wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation had been in double digits for 18 months in a row till September.\n\nMeanwhile, retail inflation in India too eased sharply in April to 4.7 per cent or an 18-month low, as against 5.7 per cent the previous month.\n\nIndia's retail inflation was above RBI's 6 per cent target for three consecutive quarters and had managed to fall back to the RBI's comfort zone only in November 2022.\n\nV K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services also said the positive note in the stocks was driven mainly by foreign fund inflows backed by improving market fundamentals.\n\n\"Domestic benchmark indices are marching ahead driven by favourable developments such as declining inflation levels, steady foreign inflows, and in anticipation of robust earnings growth on a QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) basis next quarter, due to drop in global commodity prices. The domestic CPI inflation (or retail inflation) came in better than expected at 4.7 per cent, and the WPI inflation decreased by 0.92 per cent, reaffirming RBI's decision to hold rate hikes,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nThe decline in inflation numbers is likely to push RBI to keep its \"pause\" stance intact after its monetary policy tightening for a year.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, in its first monetary policy review meeting this fiscal in April, decided to keep the key benchmark interest rate -- the repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends to other banks) -- unchanged at 6.5 per cent, to assess the effects of the policy rate tightening done so far.\n\nBarring the recent pause, the RBI has raised the repo rate by 250 basis points cumulatively since May 2022 in the fight against inflation.\n\nRaising interest rates is a monetary policy instrument that typically helps suppress demand in the economy, thereby helping the inflation rate decline.

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices opened weaker on Tuesday after gaining sharply in the previous trading session. The weakness in early trade was largely due to weakness in banking and financial services companies.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex was down 161.79 points at 61,183.92 at around 9:35 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell 31.65 points to 18,367.20.\n\nHowever, both indices made a recovery and were back in positive territory around 9:50 am\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Realty was leading from the front, followed by Nifty IT, Nifty Pharma and Nifty PSU Bank.\n\nHowever, the heavyweight banking and financials snapped their winning streak, dragging down the entire market in early trade.\n\nSome of the top gainers on the Nifty 50 were Divi's Laboratories, ONGC, Cipla, Bajaj Finance and Infosys. On the other hand, Maruti, IndusInd Bank, UPL, L&T and M&M were the top drags on the 50-share index.\n\nStock markets were expected to open on a positive note today, supported by positive retail inflation data and persistent buying by foreign institutional equities.\n\nAlso Read | Sensex, Nifty climb as investors cheer positive inflation data; auto stocks gain\n\nHopes of a debt ceiling deal in the US also boosted sentiments as Wall Street equities advanced.\n\n\"All US Indices closed on the higher side while the Asian market also trading on a positive note. On the daily chart, a modest positive candle with light upper and lower shadows formed in Nifty. The immediate support remains at 18250 while Resistance is placed at the 18520-18580 zone,\" said Om Kumar Mehra, tehcnical analyst, Choice Broking.\n\n\"A successful close over 18600 will trigger a breakout in the index. Strong FIIs buying have boosted the sentiments which had led the Index to scale higher while Bank Nifty on verge to attain all-time high. We anticipate Banking and IT stocks would hold the command for today's session,\" he added.",

Please note that this conference is being recorded.\n\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ajinkya Pandharkar from Cipla Limited. Thank you, and over to you, sir.\n\nAjinkya Pandharkar: Thank you, Dorwin. Good evening, and a very warm welcome to Cipla's Q4 FY '23 earnings call. I'm Ajinkya Pandharkar from the Investor Relations team at Cipla. Let me draw your attention to the fact that on this call, our discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other estimates about our future events.

Cipla does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new confirmation, future events or otherwise.\n\nI would like to request Umang to take over.\n\nUmang Vohra:Thank you, Ajinkya. Good evening to all of you and I appreciate your joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call for financial year '23. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we've posted on our website. I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress across our strategic priorities. In fiscal year '23, we recorded the highest ever revenue and EBITDA, including several major milestones in our One India and U.S. businesses, pivoting our business on an accelerated growth and a strong margin trajectory.\n\nWe also continue to invest capital across multiple growth initiatives, including investments in the complex pipeline in new science into our big brands and expanding our consumer portfolio among others. I would like to cover some key themes that have played out in our financial performance for the last year. One of the key themes is delivering market-beating growth in our focus markets of India, South Africa, United States and some of the large emerging markets. Our India branded prescription business delivered sustained momentum across all our therapies, achieving 13% excluding COVID year-on-year growth while the IPM growth was 8% as per IQVIA at March '23.\n\nImportantly, our overall share of chronic therapies expanded year-on-year by 300 basis points to 59% of the total portfolio, an 80 basis points increase in the market share from -- in the market\n\nPage 2 of 19\n\nCipla Limited\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nshare for the chronic therapies from 7.5% to 8.3%. We do not expect the NLEM pricing impact to influence our growth significantly as it will be balanced via allowed price increases and continued volume growth. This business has consistently posted market beating growth for 2 consecutive years as per IQVIA.\n\nIn South Africa, Cipla grew at a 3-year CAGR of 8.9% faster than the market, which is growing at 4.4%. Our focus continues on driving market-leading growth and increasing our share in the market of South Africa. I will cover the U.S. market subsequently. Within India, the other focus area for us has been growing our big brands across all our businesses. In India branded generic, we now have 21 brands featuring in the top 300 brands and which are over INR100 crores of sales as per MAT March '23. In our trade generics business, we have 8 brands that are above INR50 crores of sales and are much larger in volume terms catering to the length and breadth of the country.\n\nCipla Health has successfully transitioned and consumerized some of the existing brands into megabrands with sales of over INR100 crores. This has been achieved through leveraging brand strength to its maximum deepening market penetration, significantly higher consumer-oriented packaging and positioning. Our India consumer franchise is already tracking at INR1,000 crores plus on an annual basis, and we expect the EBITDA margin to move closer to mid-teens in FY '24 and grow sustainably from there on.\n\nI'd now like to talk a little bit about our U.S. market. One of our core themes has been to broaden our pipeline in this market. We are pleased to share that our U.S. business has crossed $200 million for the first time in this quarter. The full year for this business stood at $733 million, growing over 23% from last year. This has been achieved through our pipeline and execution.\n\nWe had announced a peptide pipeline earlier in FY '23, and this has added a new muscle of institutional capability and portfolio, which we aim to further enhance. Our lead asset of lanreotide now has 17% share in this market.\n\nWhile launches are a focus area for all markets, noteworthy of the 50-plus launches in India, trade generics market and the 32 brands launched across multiple therapies in South Africa. This new leg of revenue in South Africa is likely to offset the reduction in the tender business and the margin pressures we have seen recently.\n\nWe continue to invest in growth franchisees. In line with our strategy to continue our focus on expanding our One India franchise towards the higher share of chronic therapies, we recently signed a perpetual license agreement with Novartis for Galvus and its combination brands, which, as per MAT March '23 IQVIA had reported sales of nearly INR270 crores. This will be a strong strategic fit to strengthen our IBDs portfolio.\n\nWe also entered into a strategic partnership to market and distribute Scapho, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of psoriasis. In Cipla Health, we acquired Endura MASS, a renowned nutritional supplement, which has a niche positioning in this market. While we continue to invest in brands, we also focused investments in enhancing people capabilities\n\nPage 3 of 19\n\nCipla Limited\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nin the field force. In -- over the last 2 years, our field force in India has grown by over 800 people.\n\nOur R&D investment continues to increase. In terms of pipeline, we've made significant progress on initiation of trials across some of our complex products. On the pipeline front, we have 3 differentiated products undergoing clinical trials with filings targeted in FY '24.\n\nOur last but most clinical theme has been to derisk our U.S. portfolio. Our U.S. supply continues to be well diversified across all our sites and partner sites in -- and partner sites from our partners. On our compliance front, at Fall River, Massachusetts, we recently completed the CGMP audit, which resulted in 0483 observations. We have approval to produce our respiratory assets in this facility. Respiratory assets are being derisked to this in-house facility.\n\nFor Indore, we expect classification by mid-May. However, we do not see any risk to commercialize product portfolio. Generic Advair is already being derisked to another in-house facility. Remediation efforts are ongoing for our Goa facility, and we expect a CAPA completion by end of Q1. Reinspection is required for plant clearance, which is being targeted for quarter 3. Our generic Advair file is now solely dependent on the facility approval, having cleared all other questions from the agency. We have already commenced the derisking process for this product, as I mentioned earlier, to our other in-house facility. The value stays intact as no new generic is expected before we launch.\n\nNanopaclitaxel is being used, as I mentioned earlier, to a partner CMO site, and exhibit batches are being taken. We expect to be able to supply from 2 sites by fiscal year '25. We don't see any change to the value of this product as well as there are clearly no generic launches till date.\n\nWith this, I would now like to invite Ashish to present the financial and operational performance.\n\nAshish Adukia:Thank you, Umang. This quarter, we witnessed strong performance across all our core businesses with overall expansion and profitability. The quarter reflects our consistent performance in One India with better than market growth and our performance in our differentiated product launches in U.S., which was done earlier this year.\n\nComing to the key financial highlights for the quarter. Overall, we are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of INR5,739 crores, with full year revenue closing at INR22,753 crores. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 9% Y-o-Y on a reported basis and on ex-COVID basis, a strong 14% growth. And for the full year, the same number on a Y-o-Y growth stands at 5% on reported and 11% on ex-COVID basis.\n\nOur One India franchise further expanded its market share in a traditionally weak seasonal quarter by growing at healthy 16% on an ex-COVID basis on back of extended countrywide flu season. The North America business reported a highest ever revenue driven by traction in the differentiated portfolio with revenue of $733 million, growing at 23% Y-o-Y.\n\nOur free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continue to drive our healthy net cash position. Our reported ROIC for the trailing 12 months stood at about 24%, which is over our long-term range of 17% to 20% that we've talked about earlier. In line with our expectation,\n\nPage 4 of 19\n\nCipla Limited\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nEBITDA margins stood at 20% plus for the quarter on a reported basis, whereas we ended full year at robust 22%. This EBITDA margin is not including other income. Our EBITDA margins for the year subsumes the impact of lower-than-anticipated SAGA performance, a high inflationary market and a higher R&D spend and certain COVID provisioning. Adjusted for COVID, the margin for the full year stood at 23%.\n\nHigher R&D investments driven by ongoing clinical trials on differentiated assets, as well as other developmental efforts, including contribution to biosimilar JV was higher in the quarter by 15% versus last year and is part of our profitability model. Our reported gross margin after materials costs stood at 64% for the quarter, which is 480 basis points above last year's figures, driven by contribution from new launches and overall mix change. As you may recall, last year, we had onetime COVID charge of inventory provision in quarter 4, which had impacted the reported gross margins.\n\nTotal expenses for the quarter, including employee costs and other expenses, which stood at INR4,565 crores, up by 3.7% on a sequential basis. The other expenses, which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotions are at INR1,537 crores, increased by 6.1% sequentially, driven by judicious promotional and growth link investment. Total R&D investment for the quarter are at INR371 crores, about 6.5% of revenue and were 15% higher, like I said, on a Y-o-Y basis. R&D expense for the full year stood at INR1,344 crores, which includes material cost, depreciation, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nProfit after tax for the quarter is at INR526 crores or 9.2% of sales, adjusting for onetime impairment charge on account of divestment of certain noncore assets in Africa and Middle East, adjusted PAT stood at INR708 crores, which is 12.3% of sales. The adjusted growth rate over last year is 436 basis points and adjusted ETR, effective tax rate, is at 24%.\n\nFull year PAT is at INR2,802 crores while adjusted PAT is INR2,984 crores to 13.1% of sales. As of March '23, our debt primarily constitutes ZAR 720 million in South Africa. We have repaid our working capital loans of about $50 million in the U.S. given the interest cost environment.\n\nTurning now to our outlook. We established strong threshold for revenue growth and operating profitability with core margins trending in the 22% range.\n\nTo close, we saw robust momentum across portfolio and geographies for FY '23. The growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include continued market beating growth across One India, prescription, trade generics and consumer health. Full year operating profit in line with our guidance of about 22%, which includes continued investment in R&D programs.\n\nRobust traction in our North America franchise across complex portfolio and continued contribution from respiratory and peptide products, creating a more resilient business through de-risk portfolio and supply. And lastly, incubate and drive growth in stable geographies in international market.\n\nI would now like to thank you for your attention and will request the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nPage 5 of 19\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal Link Original Document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nCipla Ltd. published this content on 16 May 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

            "body": "The Indian equity benchmarks ended higher in the second consecutive session on May 15, posting a five-month high, supported by realty, FMCG and PSU Banks.\n\nAt close, the Sensex was up 317.81 points or 0.51 percent at 62,345.71, and the Nifty was up 84 points or 0.46 percent at 18,398.80.\n\nAmid mixed global cues, the Indian indices started on a flat note but picked up momentum as the day progressed. The falling wholesale price index (WPI) inflation into the negative territory for the first time since July 2020, also boosted the sentiments. However, the last-hour profit booking erased some of the intraday gains.\n\nHero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, ITC, Tech Mahindra and HUL were among the top gainers on the Nifty, while losers were Adani Enterprises, Cipla, BPCL, Divis Labs and Grasim Industries.\n\nExcept for power, all other sectoral indices ended in the green with the realty index up over 4 percent, FMCG and PSU Bank indices up 1 percent each, while bank, auto, capital goods, information technology and metal up 0.5 percent each.\n\nBSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.5 percent each.\n\nTrends on SGX Nifty indicate a flat to positive start for the broader index in India, with a gain of 44 points or 0.24 percent. The Nifty futures were trading around 18,447.50 level on the Singaporean Exchange at 7:25 IST.",

The decline in inflation numbers is likely to push RBI to keep its \"pause\" stance intact after its monetary policy tightening for a year.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, in its first monetary policy review meeting this fiscal in April, decided to keep the key benchmark interest rate -- the repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends to other banks) -- unchanged at 6.5 per cent, to assess the effects of the policy rate tightening done so far. Barring the recent pause, the RBI has raised the repo rate by 250 basis points cumulatively since May 2022 in the fight against inflation.\n\nRaising interest rates is a monetary policy instrument that typically helps suppress demand in the economy, thereby helping the inflation rate decline.

            "body": "New Delhi [India], May 15 (ANI): Indian stock indices started the fresh week on a firm note with support from a range of fundamentals such as continued inflow of foreign funds, easing in inflation (both retail and wholesale), and global cues.\n\nBenchmark indices Sensex and Nifty closed Monday's trade up 0.5 per cent each. Hero Motocorp, Tata Motors, ITC, Tech Mahindra, and Hindalco were the top five gainers, whereas Adani Enterprises, Cipla, BPCL, Grasim Industries, and Divis Labs were the top five losers.\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) have continued to remain net buyers in Indian stock markets for the third straight month after having sold two months on a trot in January and February, data from the National Securities Depository (NSDL) revealed. FPIs bought assets worth Rs 11,631 crore in Indian stock markets in April, according to NSDL data. In March, they bought assets worth about Rs 7,936 crore in Indian stock markets.\n\nSo far in May, they bought assets worth Rs 24,739 crore.\n\n\"Markets started the week on a firm note and gained nearly half a per cent amid mixed cues. After the flat start, the Nifty index inched gradually higher as the day progressed, however, profit-taking in the final hour trimmed the gains,\" said Ajit Mishra, VP - of Technical Research, Religare Broking.\n\n\"The rotational buying in heavyweights from the key sectors viz., banking, financial, auto and FMCG is helping the index to maintain a positive tone despite mixed global cues. And, indications are in favour of the prevailing trend continuing. Traders should align their positions accordingly and avoid contrarian trades.\"\n\nComing to wholesale inflation whose data was released today, it turned negative in April at minus 0.92 per cent, happening for the first time since July 2020. Overall wholesale inflation was at 8.39 in October and has been falling since then. Notably, the wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation had been in double digits for 18 months in a row till September.\n\nMeanwhile, retail inflation in India too eased sharply in April to 4.7 per cent or an 18-month low, as against 5.7 per cent the previous month.\n\nIndia's retail inflation was above RBI's 6 per cent target for three consecutive quarters and had managed to fall back to the RBI's comfort zone only in November 2022.\n\nV K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services also said the positive note in the stocks was driven mainly by foreign fund inflows backed by improving market fundamentals.\n\n\"Domestic benchmark indices are marching ahead driven by favourable developments such as declining inflation levels, steady foreign inflows, and in anticipation of robust earnings growth on a QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) basis next quarter, due to drop in global commodity prices.

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices extended gains at the end of Monday's trading session despite weaker global cues, supported by a dip in retail and wholesale inflation. A rally in auto stocks also boosted sentiments on Dalal Street.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex gained 317.81 points to end at 62,345.71, while the NSE Nifty 50 ended 84.05 points higher to settle at 18,398.85. Broader market indices also gained sharply in the wake of strong macro data.\n\nAll of the major sectoral indices ended in positive territory, with Nifty Media, Nifty Auto, Nifty Realty, Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services gaining the most.\n\nThe top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, ITC, Tech Mahindra and Hindalco. Tata Motors was among the top gainers as it climbed nearly 3 per cent after posting record revenue and setting its first dividend in 7 years.\n\nOn the other hand, the top drags on the 50-share index were Adani Enterprises, Cipla, BPCL, Grasim and Divi's Laboratories.\n\nThe mood on Dalal Street was lifted by positive wholesale inflation data in April. It may be noted that the country's annual wholesale price index (WPI) fell 0.92 per cent in April after rising 1.34 per cent in March.\n\nMeanwhile, India's retail inflation in April also dipped sharply to 4.70 per cent from 5.66 per cent in the previous month. The positive retail inflation data along with good Q4 results from Tata Motors and DLF helped boost the mood on Dalal Street.\n\n\" The overall picture is positive, and the market will continue to purchase on dips until the important support level of 18200 is not breached on the downside. Bank Nifty is driving the market uptrend, closing at all-time highs,\" said Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking.",

            "title": "Cipla logs decent Q4; product launch delays, regulatory risks near-term overhang",
            "body": "Cipla Ltd reported an upswing in its Q4FY23 results, with revenues advancing 9.1% year-on-year (YoY) to ₹5,739 crore. This growth was primarily driven by an encouraging performance in the US market. The homegrown multinational pharmaceutical company also saw significant improvement in its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) margin, which rose to 20.5% from 14.5% the previous year, a result of increased sales and reduced expenditures.\n\nHowever, Cipla's growth prospects for FY24 face challenges, including delays in the launch of key products in the US and increased costs. The company's gAdvair and gAbraxane products are awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) due to issues flagged at its Indore and Goa facilities. In February, the USFDA inspected the Indore plant, with classification expected by mid-May. Furthermore, Cipla had received an adverse outcome, Official Action Indicated (OAI), from the USFDA for its Goa site in September 2019. The management expects reinspection in Q3FY24.\n\nTo mitigate risks, Cipla has begun filing for approval from dual facilities for its critical products, starting with gAdvair and gAbraxane. However, the approval process is expected to take over 12 months, potentially dampening near-term growth prospects in the US market, which contributed about 26% of FY23 revenue.\n\nDespite these challenges, Cipla remains confident in its continued growth in the US market. The company currently has three differentiated products undergoing clinical trials, with filings targeted for FY24.\n\nAccording to analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, \"While Cipla has started de-risking the potential products to alternate site, they would have certain gestation period before gaining commercial benefits.\" The company is expected to deliver 8.5% US sales CAGR over FY23-25, they added in a report dated 13 May.\n\nAnother concern is elevated costs due to sales force expansion, research and development expenses, remediation measures, and additional sites for critical products in the US generics segment. This could impact Ebitda margin, with management guiding for a 22% margin in FY24 versus 23% in FY23.\n\nThese near-term challenges may limit significant stock upsides, as Cipla shares have already fallen about 22% from their 52-week high of ₹1,185.25 apiece seen in November. Nevertheless, the long-term growth story appears intact. Analysts from Nuvama Research believe that \"Cipla is best placed for sustained growth given its consistent India business and niche US pipeline.\" The brokerage has cut FY24E/25E earnings per share by 14%/8% to factor in a delay in launches and salesforce expansion.",

We cut our earnings estimates for FY24/FY25 by 7%/4% factoring in: a) delays in approval for g-Advair/g-Abraxane, b) costs related to additional field force in DF segment, remediation measures and adding alternate sites for critical products in the US generics segment.\n\nOutlook\n\nWe value Cipla at 21x 12M forward earnings and add NPV of INR30 related to g-Revlimid to arrive at our TP of INR970. We expect 12.3% earnings CAGR over FY23-25, led by 9%/11% sales CAGR in DF/NA segments and marginal improvement in profitability.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the future financial operating performance of Alvotech and may include, for example, Alvotech's expectations regarding competitive advantages, business prospects and opportunities including pipeline product development, future plans and intentions, results, level of activities, performance, goals or achievements or other future events, regulatory review and interactions, the satisfactory responses to the FDA's inspection findings and resolution of other deficiencies conveyed following the inspection of Alvotech's manufacturing site, the potential approval and commercial launch of its product candidates, the timing of regulatory approval and market launches, and the estimated size of the total addressable market of Alvotech's pipeline products.

            "body": "Drug major Cipla on Friday said its consolidated net profit increased by 45 per cent to Rs 526 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023, driven by robust sales across the domestic business and US market.\n\nThe Mumbai-based company had reported a net profit of Rs 362 crore for the January-March quarter of 2021-22 fiscal.\n\nTotal revenue from operations rose to Rs 5,739 crore for the fourth quarter as compared with Rs 5,260 crore in the year-ago period, Cipla said in a regulatory filing.\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2023, the drug maker reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,802 crore as against Rs 2,517 crore in FY22. Total revenue rose to Rs 22,753 crore last fiscal as against Rs 21,763 crore in 2021-22 fiscal.\n\n\"In FY23, we recorded the highest ever revenue with EBITDA crossing Rs 5,000 crore for the first time. Our One-India business continued the double-digit trajectory growing at 13 per cent ex-Covid during the year led by branded prescription and sustained growth across our acute and chronic therapies,\" Cipla MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra noted.\n\nThe company's continued focus on differentiated portfolio has strengthened its US business which posted highest ever quarterly revenue at USD 204 million and USD 733 million for FY23, he added.\n\n\"Adjusting for covid, our core operating profitability continues to be strong at 23 per cent expanding by 100 bps over last year. We are excited for the upcoming year, where we look forward to deepening our leadership in branded markets and expanding our differentiated pipeline in the US,\" Vohra noted.\n\nThe company said its board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 8.50 per share of Rs 2 each for the financial year ended March 31, 2023.\n\nShares of the company were trading 0.73 per cent down at Rs 936.80 apiece on the BSE.",

These reports offer BQ Prime's subscribers an opportunity to expand their understanding of companies, sectors and the economy.\n\nCipla Ltd.'s Q4 FY23 results were in-line with our estimates on both revenue as well as profitability front, although margins came in higher-than-expected.\n\nRevenue grew by 9.1% YoY (14% ex-Covid) to Rs 57.4 billion (our estimate: Rs 57.6 billion) mainly on the back of strong growth in the U.S., which was partially offset by a decline in SAGA and active pharma ingredient sales. U.S. revenue grew by 27.5% YoY, mainly driven by Lanreotide 505b2 and Revlimid.\n\nOn QoQ basis, U.S. revenue grew by 4.6% despite a high base of seasonality benefit. Domestic revenue grew by 3.5% YoY while excluding Covid sales, the same grew by 16% YoY.\n\nEbitda margin came in at 20.5%, higher than our estimate of 19.3% mainly on the back of lower other expenditure. Adjusted net profit grew by 59.3% YoY to Rs 6.5 billion (our estimate Rs 6.5 billion), mainly driven by a strong operational performance and higher other income, which was partially offset by higher tax rate.\n\nCipla has already filed Advair, Paclitaxel and other critical products from other own/partner sites and going forward it will file all critical products from dual sites to de-risk approval.\n\nAdverse observations at its Indore plant and likely delay in the launch of Advair remain an overhang in the near term. However, we remain positive on Cipla mainly due to high branded business contribution, robust India franchise, healthy U.S. pipeline, decent margins and improving return ratios.",

            "body": "Equity benchmark Nifty50 rose about a half-a-per cent in morning trade on May 15 to reclaim 18,400 levels with decent gains in most sectors.\n\nThe index hit its all-time high of 18,887.60 on December 1, 2022. Analysts believe if the uptrend sustains, the benchmark index can hit an all-time high level by the next month.\n\nRead more: Nifty Predictions for May: Can Nifty hit an all-time high in May? Here's what top technical analysts think\n\nMarket sentiment is positive on healthy domestic macroeconomic indicators, in-line March quarter numbers and sustained foreign capital inflow. The expectation of an end to aggressive rate hikes is another factor that is working in favour of the market.\n\nAnalysts recommend buying quality stocks in this market to maximise gains. Based on the recommendations of several analysts, here are nine stocks that can give healthy returns in the next 3-4 weeks.\n\nHindustan Unilever is currently trading near ₹2,645, indicating a higher high higher low formation on the daily chart.\n\nRSI indicator's current trading range of 68.48 levels is also showing strength. The stock is currently trading above all of the key moving averages.\n\nThe Bollinger band continues expanding on the weekly chart, with the price trading above the band's centre line, indicating the stock's strength.\n\nA small resistance is placed near ₹2,650 levels; if the stock surpasses this level, it may move towards ₹2,760 levels and higher.\n\n\"With a medium-term target price of ₹2,760, we advise purchasing Hindustan Unilever at the current market price. It can also be accumulated close to ₹2,570 levels. If the price closes below ₹2,500, our analysis will be invalid,\" said the analyst.\n\nThe stock is currently trading above all of the important moving averages. The stock has a solid support foundation near ₹3,200.\n\nThe stock can be bought on every drop because the breakout is supported by massive volumes. A weekly closing at all-time high levels always suggests that the stock is strong.\n\nAfter a squeeze, the Bollinger band continues to grow on the weekly chart, with the price trading near the band's upper line.\n\nA break of the higher line on the band will bring the stock upward.\n\n\"We recommend buying Polycab stock at the current market price with a medium-term target of ₹3,620. It can also be accumulated near ₹3,320. If the price closes below ₹3,200, our analysis will be invalid,\" said the analyst.\n\nCipla has been demonstrating a consistent upward trend within a positive rising channel. This bullish movement is further supported by its trading position above its short-term moving averages of 20 and 50, indicating a favourable short-term momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61 and is trending upward, suggesting increasing buying pressure and positive investor sentiment.\n\nFurthermore, Cipla has recently surpassed a significant trendline resistance, which had been acting as a formidable supply zone since October of the previous year. This breakout is a strong indication of a potential upward surge in the stock's price.\n\n\"Considering the aforementioned technical indicators and breakout, it appears to be an opportune time to consider purchasing Cipla at its current market price for the target range of ₹980-1,005. Our Views will be negated below ₹900,\" said the analyst.\n\nFor the last three years, this counter has been in a consolidation mode, with a trading range of ₹55-90.\n\nLast week, it gave a clean breakout from the mentioned trading range and quite comfortably traded above it. Additionally, the current price action on a weekly scale is trading above William Alligator (trend-following indicator) which is a positive sign.\n\nAfter making the top of ₹828.50 on November 9, 2022, it started making lower tops and lower bottom structures which resulted in a 23 per cent cut in price. From Feb 2023 to March 2023, it made bullish divergence on a daily scale - the price was making lower lows, but KST (Know Sure Thing) was making higher lows since then the said counter has reversed nicely.\n\nAt the current juncture, price action is above William alligator (trend following indicator) which is echoing towards further upside in the counter.\n\nBetween June 2022 and March 2023, this stock made a solid base near ₹300 levels and has reversed nicely from those levels.\n\nAdditionally, it has made a bullish BAT pattern on a weekly scale along with bullish divergence i.e. price was making lower lows and RSI was making higher lows.\n\nThe stock has taken support near ₹850, making a higher bottom formation pattern on the daily chart. A gradual rise has improved the bias making the chart look attractive for further upside movement in the coming days.\n\nThe RSI also indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy and with decent volume participation.\n\nThe stock is coming out of a downward channel pattern with a positive candle. The stock has witnessed decent erosion from ₹250 levels, bottoming out near ₹180 levels, gradually indicating improvement in the bias.\n\nCurrently, a positive candle pattern indicates strength. The stock has the potential to rise further in the coming days.\n\nWith the RSI also going strong, it has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy.\n\nThe stock has more or less made a double bottom formation on the daily chart taking support near ₹945 and has shown signs of reversal to improve the bias.\n\nThe indicators are all favourable with the RSI indicating a reversal to anticipate for a further rise in the coming days.",

            "body": "BENGALURU, May 15 (Reuters) -\n\nIndian shares advanced on Monday as strong earnings from Tata Motors Ltd and DLF Ltd added to the optimism over cooling domestic retail inflation.\n\nThe Nifty 50 was up 0.38% at 18,382.90 as of 10:22 a.m. IST, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.43% to 62,296.54.\n\nEleven of the 13 major sectoral indexes advanced, with auto and realty stocks rising nearly 1% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nTata Motors, which gained 4%, powered the rise in the auto index, while DLF, which rose as much as 4.89% to a fresh 52-week high, pushed up the realty index. Both companies had reported a surge in March-quarter profit.\n\n\"Expect further consolidation due to mixed signals from the global front,\" said Ajit Mishra, vice president - technical research at Religare Broking Ltd.\n\n\"There will be no shortage of trading opportunities, thanks to the ongoing earnings season.\"\n\nIndia's retail inflation data eased to an 18-month low of 4.7% in April, well below the central bank's upper tolerance limit of 6% for the second consecutive month. India's wholesale price index inflation for April, due on Monday, is also expected to ease on base effects.\n\nEconomists now expect India's central bank to maintain a \"pause\" on rate hikes, following the slide in inflation.\n\nGlobal equities, on the other hand, remained subdued, after a survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a six-month low in May on fears of a potential recession. Caution ahead of key macro data and rate decision from China also weighed on sentiment.\n\nAmong individual stocks, drug maker Cipla Ltd lost more than 4%, the most among Nifty 50 stocks, after reporting a smaller-than-expected profit.\n\nMeanwhile Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which operates the DMart chain of retail stores, fell as much as 4.65% after reporting a drop in profit margins.

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices rose in early trade on Monday after retail inflation dipped below 5 per cent in April for the first time in 18 months. However, market gains were capped by weak global cues due to the possibility of a slowdown in the US economy.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex was up 151.81 points to 62,179.71 at around 9:37 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 was trading 42.75 points higher at 18,357.55. Broader markets were mixed, with indices juggling between positive and negative territory.\n\nHeavyweight financial services and auto stocks continued their positive run, while IT, bank, and realty stocks also made decent headway in early trade. On the other hand, metal and pharma stocks struggled in the wake of global weakness.\n\nThe top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Auto, and Britannia. Cipla, Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Maruti, and Divi's Laboratories were the top drags on the 50-share index.\n\nThe mood on Dalal Street remained upbeat after retail inflation in April dipped to 4.70 per cent from 5.66 per cent in the previous month.\n\nCooling inflation is good news for not only citizens but also market investors as it will prompt the Reserve Bank of India to not increase interest rates this year.\n\nWhile positive inflation data lifted the mood on Dalal Street, weakening global cues continue to keep investors on edge.\n\nIt may be noted that Wall Street equities declined after a survey showed that US consumer sentiment slumped to a six-month low in May on increased recession fears. Asian markets were also under the pump ahead of the rate decision by China's central bank.\n\nAccording to analysts, markets are currently awaiting fresh cues after a charged-up Q4 earnings season.\n\nBoth benchmark indices have gained sharply over the past two months, supported by both domestic and foreign investors. It remains to be seen if domestic markets can continue their rally or will the global slowdown spoil the mood.",

Notably, revenue was largely in-line with the Street's expectation of Rs 5,744.42 crore.\n\nCatch all the market action on our live blog\n\nHere is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post March quarter earnings:\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher\n\nCipla's Q4FY23 EBITDA (Rs 11.7 billion; 20.5% OPM) was largely in-line with broking firm estimates, aided by higher GMs (64%) and US sales of US$204mn.\n\nIt continues to remain positive on growth across key segments including India and US given 1) strong traction in respiratory and other portfolios, 2) potential growth of +10% in domestic formulations and 3) sustainability of current US revenues, backed by future key launches over FY25. Despite recent FDA issues, we expect a 14% EPS CAGR over FY23-25E.\n\nMaintain 'Buy' rating and estimates with unchanged Target Price of Rs1,070 based on 22x FY25E EPS. Any further FDA escalation to Indore unit and erosion in key products in the US will be a key risk to our call\n\nMotilal Oswal\n\nCipla reported lower-than-expected performance in 4QFY23, led by higher operational costs. It achieved the highest-ever annual earnings in FY23, driven by strong traction in North America (NA) sales.\n\nCipla grew better than the industry in the domestic formulation (DF) market by ~500bp YoY in FY23.\n\nBrokerage house cut its earnings estimates for FY24/FY25 by 7%/4% factoring in a) delays in approval for g-Advair/g-Abraxane, b) costs related to additional field force in the DF segment, remediation measures and adding alternate sites for critical products in the US generics segment.\n\nIt values Cipla at 21x 12M forward earnings and adds NPV of Rs 30 related to g-Revlimid to arrive at a Target Price of Rs 970.\n\nMotilal Oswal expects a 12.3% earnings CAGR over FY23-25, led by 9%/11% sales CAGR in DF/NA segments and marginal improvement in profitability. Considering a delay in potential launches in NA, regulatory risk at Indore and limited upside from current levels, we maintain our Neutral rating on the stock.\n\nMacquarie\n\nThe research house assigned an 'Outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share.\n\nThe Q4 revenue was largely in line, however, the company's EBITDA beat the estimates by 8%, and the adjusted PAT by 7%.\n\nThe EBITDA margin is at 20.5% against the estimates of 19%.\n\nThe PAT missed estimates by 21% due to a one-time goodwill impairment charge.\n\nJPMorgan\n\nJPMorgan has kept an 'overweight' rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share.\n\nThe long-term growth levers are in place and the FY24 outlook remains steady. The Q4 was ahead of expectations, with the adjusted PAT beating estimates, driven by strong growth in India.\n\nJPMorgan maintains a positive outlook on the market-beating growth outlook for the India business.\n\nThe strong pipeline of complex assets to drive longer-term growth in the US beyond FY25.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities\n\nThe brokerage firm has maintained 'buy' rating on the stock and set a target price of Rs 1,100 per share.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, company EBITDA beat expectations, primarily driven by higher sales in the US and other export markets.\n\nThe USFDA compliance status for the Pithampur facility is expected to be disclosed in the next few days.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities incorporates the OAI (Official Action Indicated) status into their estimates building Advair launch from the Fall River facility in the third quarter of FY25.\n\nDespite a delay in the launch of Abraxane, expect the company to post a healthy 19% EPS (Earnings Per Share) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the period from FY23 to FY25.",

            "title": "Agreements inked during pandemic for Covid therapies poised for change ",
            "body": "Cross-country agreements for Covid therapies, inked during the pandemic, could now see a change, with the World Health Organization declaring that Covid-19 was no longer a global health emergency.\n\nRoyalty payments would kick-in, some as early as June, unless there is a communication to the contrary, a representative with a domestic drugmaker told businessline. Several collaborations had been formalised between innovator and generic companies, where the former had not sought royalty payments on products licensed out to the generic drugmaker, as long at the pandemic lasted.\n\nIndian drug and vaccine makers were part of major collaborations including on antivirals Remdesivir (from Gilead Sciences), Molnupiravir (Merck, Sharp & Dohme - MSD) and Paxlovid (Pfizer). AstraZeneca inked an alliance with Serum Institute of India on its Covid-19 vaccine. Domestic drug majors Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, Hetero, Glenmark and Torrent Pharma, to name a few, were among the direct licensees or sub-licensees (through agreements with Medicines Patent Pool - MPP), for different antivirals and vaccines.\n\nAn MSD spokesperson said, \"Under the terms of the agreement, now that the WHO is no longer classifying Covid-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, MSD, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Emory University will receive royalties for sales of molnupiravir as on June 1, 2023 (5 per cent of net public sector sales and 10 percent of net private market sales). We did not enter these agreements for financial gain; we prioritised these as part of our ongoing commitment to facilitate availability of molnupiravir to countries globally.\"\n\nWhile the demand for Covid-19 therapies have fallen, there's scope for these products, if it was repurposed, for example, explained an official with a domestic drug company, and licensee on multiple Covid-19 therapies.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson pointed out, though the global emergency had ended, WHO emphasised that the virus was here to stay, and all countries needed to continue managing Covid-19 and other infectious diseases impacting them.\n\n\"Broad access to Covid-19 vaccines and treatment, including Paxlovid, will remain for people who need them. We remain committed to our agreements with UNICEF, MPP and Global Fund for supply of PAXLOVID for eligible high-risk patients in these markets,\" they said.\n\nBroader reach\n\nThe Pfizer-MPP agreement enabled broader reach and local manufacturing partnerships for Paxlovid. \"Through this agreement, voluntary licences for the drug have been provided to 35 qualified manufacturers across the world, of which 21 are Indian companies, to supply a generic version of Paxlovid to 95 LMICs (low and middle income countries); covering approximately 53 percent of the world's population),\" Pfizer said.\n\nLast March, an MPP note on the Paxlovid sub-licensing agreement had said: \"Following the pandemic period, sales to low-income countries will remain royalty free, lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries will be subject to a 5 per cent royalty for sales to the public sector and a 10 percent royalty for sales to the private sector.\"\n\nWHO's former Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan hoped the collaborations would continue, to keep therapies affordable and accessible. \"The pandemic is not over, Covid has not gone away, people are still going to get sick, people are still going to need drugs and diagnostics,\" she told the paper.\n\nMany companies involved in these collaborations (Indian and foreign) were contacted by the newspaper for comment on the development. Some did not respond, others did, anonymously.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 14, 2023",

            "title": "Godrej unlocks memories from the the almirah to share its biz history ",
            "body": "Imagine a fat book devoted to the art of sitting! From the Frugal to the Ornate, Stories of the Seat in India is a delightful chronicle of an everyday object that is indispensable in our lives. The book, put together by Sarita Sundar, a researcher, designer and writer, is brought out by Godrej Archives, and takes you on a journey of mats, moodahs, sofas, chairs and more through the ages. From the rural to the regal, the lounge chair to the office chair, it's all documented there in loving detail. The company has been promoting the book through discussions and exhibits.\n\nWhy would Godrej Archives spend so much resource and time producing a voluminous tome on chairs? Jamshyd N Godrej, Chairman and Managing Director Godrej & Boyce explains in his note in the book, \"With this book, we also reflect on Godrej's vast contribution of almost a century to the modern furniture industry in India.\"\n\nTracing the roots\n\nIn a most subtle way, the book conveys the brand values of Godrej products. And it also beautifully details the historical trends and patterns that shaped the brand's products.\n\nThe aim and purpose of Godrej Archives, set up by Sohrab Godrej in 1997 when the company was celebrating its centenary was to document its business history but as Vrunda Pathare, Head of Godrej Archives, explains, \"We also realised that it's not just the story of Godrej, as companies don't operate in a vacuum. It had to be closely connected with what was happening in the nation - the trends, the consumer patterns. It was a larger history that we were looking at and we were trying to position Godrej within that larger history.\"\n\nFor instance, in the 1930s, when thanks to TISCO and IISCO steel production really climbed in the country, it influenced the move to steel furniture, and steel began defining the concept of modernity. Trends like those are captured.\n\nAs Pathare points out, several organisations -- the Tatas, SBI , RBI -- have painstakingly documented their business histories and increasingly more-like Wipro and Cipla are beginning to dive into their pasts. But where Godrej takes a different tack is in the width of its perspectives. As Pathare says, \"Corporate past need not be just specific to the management practices or hardcore business history, but it can even be about the consumers' history.\"\n\nThis realisation actually came in, Pathare, says when they started interacting with people who had Godrej products and discovered the deep emotional connects they had with them. \"You know -- the steel cupboards, the refrigerator and so on, people had so many stories.\"\n\nThat's actually when the Archives unit began to think about inviting scholars. Just before the lockdown, it started a 'scholar-in-residence' programme with Lakshmi Subramaniam, a history professor, and BITS Pilani teacher, becoming the first scholar. \"She started looking at three products, which is the Godrej Storewell, the Godrej refrigerator and a chair. And completed a monograph.\"\n\nWhile the formal scholar in residence programme has started only recently, in 2009, when Godrej closed down its typrewriter manufacturing, it realised that it was its responsibility as the last manufacturer of the product to tell the story of the typewriter. After all this was a product that had impacted many lives, and made many careers. That's when the idea of publications really began.\n\nApart from the typewriter and the chair's stories, the unit has also documented people stories. For instance, a few years ago, the Archives team captured the story of the Navganis, a migrant community that has worked as loaders in Godrej factories since 1940.\n\nThe outside world can enjoy the work of the archives by visiting the permanent exhibition at the Godrej campus. But more importantly, the work of the archives is closely integrated into many functions of the company itself -- HR, corporate communications, brand building and so on. \"Establishing the value of archives in the normal business processes is something that we always worked on,\" says Pathare.\n\nAnd it is not just the past the Archives team is diving into. It is constantly documenting the ever changing present as well for posterity.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 14, 2023",

            "title": "Three bank stocks Rahul Shah is bullish on",
            "body": "At a given price, a lot of stocks in the new age businesses like Paytm, Zomato, are on the top of our mind which look interesting after the steep fall in the stock prices, says Rahul Shah, VP-Equity Advisory, MOFSL. Edited excerpts:\n\nThis week we got earnings from a lot of auto majors as well as pharma majors. What is your reading of the numbers from the likes of Doctor Reddy's, Cipla, Dr Lal Path Labs etc?\n\nA lot of companies' numbers have been reported by and large in the Nifty universe as well. If we talk about the major numbers which were reported this week in the pharma pack, I think both the numbers for Cipla and Dr Reddy's were below estimates of what the street was estimating. We have also seen the stocks have been punished by the markets so I feel that the numbers are weak.\n\nThe most important thing is to look at what happens in the next quarter and I think a couple of big pharma names are still left. Sun Pharma is still left and I think Sun has been quite strong. If you look at the entire pharma stocks basket, if you look at the large cap space, I think the numbers reported for the last two quarters are pretty decent for it. So that is more important to look at for the Sun Pharma numbers and what the management commentary is, which is going to be most important.\n\nSecondly, when we see Mankind's listing, which was a blockbuster, and look at the valuation vis-à-vis the listed side, then I think a lot of pharma names are also undervalued at this point of time. In a mid cap space Gland, which has been underperforming for quite some time and then in the last two quarters, the numbers were below estimates. The stock has also been decently down. So I feel one should focus on these two names which I have been talking about.\n\nDo you expect that there is limited headroom for upside from here on or do you believe that the broader markets will continue to get that charge once again with the FII inflows that we are seeing continue for the 11th straight day?\n\nThe most important thing to look at is the Q4 numbers by and large there are no negative surprises from the large names. I think they were what the street was estimating or better. If we look at financials, which have given blockbuster numbers, HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, Axis all of them had superior numbers. If we talk about PSU banks as well we had a good set of numbers from the large banks. So I think financials remain the top bets. Secondly, if we talk about IT names where there was a major disruption in the earnings and I think we did see the stocks correcting anywhere between 10-15% or more. They are just settling out over there also. So I feel IT sorted, auto we had a decent set of numbers. It was a mixed bag if you look at two wheeler space.\n\nThere could be a stock specific market from here onwards which is what is happening in spite of the straight 11 days and the FIIs buying I think we have seen that a few stocks and select pockets have been moving up. So I think it will be very select stocks from here and going forward that is going to be the key part.\n\nWe read a lot of headlines coming in with respect to ONDC, how there was a discount war or how there could be some caps on discounting, etc as well. What impact could it have on the likes of Zomato and valuation of even other companies because the likes of Nykaa etc have been underperforming?\n\nAfter the strong sell off in most of the new age businesses I think some of them have become interesting. Zomato is one of them, which we have seen some 10-15% momentum building up from the near term lows. We believe it is not going to get more impacted by this ONDC thing, which we came out of the clarification also on the report perspective as well.\n\nAnd talking about the other new businesses, I think Paytm, which reported the numbers last week, the commentary that the management gave was quite encouraging. So I think that looks interesting at that price. At a given price, a lot of stocks in the new age businesses like Paytm, Zomato, are on the top of our mind which look interesting after the steep fall in the stock prices. Nykaa, also, somewhere or the other place will make some bottom and then I think post numbers will come back. Overall, by and large, these stocks remain convincing in the new businesses.\n\nWhat are your top bets within financials, private banks, public sector banks, NBFCs?\n\nPrivate banks have had a very good set of numbers and like Axis Bank has underperformed vis-à-vis other three private banks. Axis remains the top bet, with a solid performance this quarter and going forward, they should deliver and the commentary was also very strong. So I think Axis remains the top bet followed by State Bank coming out with their numbers next week.\n\nSo, State Bank should be interesting to watch. Last two quarters have been very bumper results for them and we have to look at it going forward how the street reacts post State Bank numbers. These two banks look promising from our standpoint and then a private sector bank, like ICICI Bank and HDFC both have delivered decent numbers. So ICICI from the wholesale banking pack I think we prefer that. We like all of the banks but I think the preference would be Axis, ICICI and SBI.\n\nREAD SOURCE",

            "title": "Three bank stocks Rahul Shah is bullish on",
            "body": "According to Rahul Shah, VP-Equity Advisory, MOFSL, there could be a stock specific market from here onwards which is what is happening in spite of the straight 11 days and the FIIs buying.At a given price, a lot of stocks in the new age businesses like Paytm, Zomato, are on the top of our mind which look interesting after the steep fall in the stock prices, says Rahul Shah, VP-Equity Advisory, MOFSL. Edited excerpts:\n\nThis week we got earnings from a lot of auto majors as well as pharma majors. What is your reading of the numbers from the likes of Doctor Reddy's, Cipla, Dr Lal Path Labs etc?\n\nA lot of companies' numbers have been reported by and large in the Nifty universe as well. If we talk about the major numbers which were reported this week in the pharma pack, I think both the numbers for Cipla and Dr Reddy's were below estimates of what the street was estimating. We have also seen the stocks have been punished by the markets so I feel that the numbers are weak.\n\nThe most important thing is to look at what happens in the next quarter and I think a couple of big pharma names are still left. Sun Pharma is still left and I think Sun has been quite strong. If you look at the entire pharma stocks basket, if you look at the large cap space, I think the numbers reported for the last two quarters are pretty decent for it. So that is more important to look at for the Sun Pharma numbers and what the management commentary is, which is going to be most important.\n\nSecondly, when we see Mankind's listing, which was a blockbuster, and look at the valuation vis-à-vis the listed side, then I think a lot of pharma names are also undervalued at this point of time. In a mid cap space Gland, which has been underperforming for quite some time and then in the last two quarters, the numbers were below estimates. The stock has also been decently down. So I feel one should focus on these two names which I have been talking about.\n\nDo you expect that there is limited headroom for upside from here on or do you believe that the broader markets will continue to get that charge once again with the FII inflows that we are seeing continue for the 11th straight day?\n\nThe most important thing to look at is the Q4 numbers by and large there are no negative surprises from the large names. I think they were what the street was estimating or better. If we look at financials, which have given blockbuster numbers, HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, Axis all of them had superior numbers. If we talk about PSU banks as well we had a good set of numbers from the large banks. So I think financials remain the top bets.\n\nSecondly, if we talk about IT names where there was a major disruption in the earnings and I think we did see the stocks correcting anywhere between 10-15% or more. They are just settling out over there also. So I feel IT sorted, auto we had a decent set of numbers. It was a mixed bag if you look at two wheeler space.\n\nThere could be a stock specific market from here onwards which is what is happening in spite of the straight 11 days and the FIIs buying I think we have seen that a few stocks and select pockets have been moving up. So I think it will be very select stocks from here and going forward that is going to be the key part.\n\nWe read a lot of headlines coming in with respect to ONDC, how there was a discount war or how there could be some caps on discounting, etc as well. What impact could it have on the likes of Zomato and valuation of even other companies because the likes of Nykaa etc have been underperforming?\n\nAfter the strong sell off in most of the new age businesses I think some of them have become interesting. Zomato is one of them, which we have seen some 10-15% momentum building up from the near term lows. We believe it is not going to get more impacted by this ONDC thing, which we came out of the clarification also on the report perspective as well.\n\nAnd talking about the other new businesses, I think Paytm, which reported the numbers last week, the commentary that the management gave was quite encouraging. So I think that looks interesting at that price. At a given price, a lot of stocks in the new age businesses like Paytm, Zomato, are on the top of our mind which look interesting after the steep fall in the stock prices. Nykaa, also, somewhere or the other place will make some bottom and then I think post numbers will come back. Overall, by and large, these stocks remain convincing in the new businesses.\n\nWhat are your top bets within financials, private banks, public sector banks, NBFCs?\n\nPrivate banks have had a very good set of numbers and like Axis Bank has underperformed vis-à-vis other three private banks. Axis remains the top bet, with a solid performance this quarter and going forward, they should deliver and the commentary was also very strong. So I think Axis remains the top bet followed by State Bank coming out with their numbers next week.\n\nSo, State Bank should be interesting to watch. Last two quarters have been very bumper results for them and we have to look at it going forward how the street reacts post State Bank numbers. These two banks look promising from our standpoint and then a private sector bank, like ICICI Bank and HDFC both have delivered decent numbers. So ICICI from the wholesale banking pack I think we prefer that. We like all of the banks but I think the preference would be Axis, ICICI and SBI.",

            "body": "Buy or sell stocks: Despite weakness in Asian stock market after the soft US economic data, Indian stock market finished higher on the weekend session last week. NSE Nifty added 17 points and finished at 18,314 whereas BSE Sensex went up 123 points and closed at 62,027 levels whereas Bank Nifty index gained 318 points and ended at 43,793 mark. In broad market, small-cap index ended marginally lower while mid-cap index lost 0.33 per cent.\n\nSumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking believes that Indian stock market is in uptrend and 'buy on dips' would be an idea strategy. However, he advised positional and short term investors to remain vigilant about the Q4 results as it would help them maintain stock specific trade and investment strategy. Asked about stocks to buy when stock market opens after the weekend holidays, Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking recommended three stocks to buy on Monday -- Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Polycab and Cipla.\n\nSumeet Bagadia listed out following details in regard to those buy or sell stocks:\n\n1] Hindustan Unilever Ltd or HUL: HINDUNILVR or HUL share price is currently trading near ₹2623, indicating a higher high higher low formation on the daily chart. Strength is shown by the RSI indicator's current trading range of 68.48 levels. The stock is currently trading above all of the key moving averages. The Bollinger band continues to expand on the weekly chart, with the price trading above the band's center line, indicating the stock's strength.\n\nA small resistance is placed near ₹2650 levels; if the stock surpasses this level, it may move towards 2760 levels and higher. With a medium-term target price of 2760, Sumeet Bagadia advised purchasing HINDUNILVR at the CMP of ₹2620. It can also be accumulated close to ₹2570 levels. If the price closes below 2500, our analysis will be regarded as being invalid, said Sumeet Bagadia.\n\n2] Polycab: Polycab share price is currently trading at all-time highs of ₹3389, with a daily breakout over ₹3360 signaling strength. The stock is currently trading above all of the important moving averages. The stock has a solid support foundation near ₹3200. Polycab can be bought on every drop because the breakout is being supported by massive volumes.\n\nA weekly closing at all-time high levels always suggests that the stock is strong. After a squeeze, the Bollinger band continues to grow on the weekly chart, with the price trading near the band's upper line. A break of the higher line on the band will bring the stock upward.\n\nSumeet Bagadia recommended purchasing Polycab shares at the current market price of ₹3389 with a medium-term target goal of ₹3620. It can also be accumulated near to ₹3320 levels. If the price closes below ₹3200, the analysis will be considered invalid, Bagadia said.\n\n3] Cipla: Cipla share price is currently trading at ₹937, demonstrating a consistent upward trend within a positive rising channel. This bullish movement is further supported by its trading position above its short-term moving averages of 20 and 50, indicating a favorable short-term momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61 and is trending upward, suggesting increasing buying pressure and positive investor sentiment.\n\nFurthermore, Cipla has recently surpassed a significant trendline resistance, which had been acting as a formidable supply zone since October of the previous year.\n\nThis breakout is a strong indication of a potential upward surge in the stock's price. Considering the aforementioned technical indicators and breakout, it appears to be an opportune time to consider purchasing Cipla at its current market price for the target range of ₹980 to ₹1005. Our Views will be negated below ₹900, Choice Broking expert said.",

            "title": "Cipla Q4 net profit jumps 45% on strong US show",
            "body": "The company's net profit however was impacted by one-time charges (impairment losses) worth ₹182.42 crore, pertaining to an acquisition in Uganda and its assets in Yemen.\n\nAdjusted for the same, the company's net profit stood at ₹708 crore during Q4. The company's revenues at ₹5,739.3 crore grew 9% year-on-year during Q4. The growth was driven by the company's strong performance in the US while India business supported it.\n\nThe North America sales, contributing slightly less than a third to overall revenues, marked a strong growth of 39% year-on-year. In constant currency terms at $204 million, the US sales grew 27% YoY. Robust momentum continues in the differentiated portfolio and Lanreotide market share now stands at 17%, the company said. Lanreotide is a drug that regulates the production of hormones.\n\nIts domestic business that contributes two-fifths to overall revenues reported a growth of 3% year-on-year. Adjusted for the covid treatment drug contributions, the growth was at 16%.\n\nWeakness continues in South Africa and SAGA (South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Global Access) business that saw revenues decline 7% and 13% respectively. However, on a sequential basis there is improvement in supply and the South Africa and SAGA revenues were up 22% and 12%, respectively.\n\nThe emerging markets' sales (14% overall) remained impacted by currency volatility and grew 6% YoY, ex-covid, in rupee terms. The company's reported Ebitda at ₹1,174 crore during Q4 which grew 54% year-on-year and margins improved 596 basis points to 20.5%. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation.\n\nDuring FY23, the company's revenues at ₹22,753 crore grew 11% year-on-year. The reported net profit at ₹2,802 crore and adjusted net profit at ₹2,984 crore grew 11% each over FY22. The reported Ebitda at ₹5,027 crore grew 10% year-on-year while margins expanded to 22.1% in FY23 over 21% in FY22.\n\nUmang Vohra, managing director and Global CEO of Cipla Ltd, said, \"Adjusting for covid, our core operating profitability continues to be strong at 23% (during FY23) expanding by 100 bps over last year. We are excited for the upcoming year, where we look forward to deepening our leadership in branded markets and expanding our differentiated pipeline in the US.\"\n\nVohra expects adjusted Ebitda margins to remain at 23% or more during FY24. He also expects to maintain the quarterly run rate of $195-200 million in revenues from the US markets. While growth momentum in the US remains strong, the launches of two key respiratory products, the generics of Advair and Abraxane remain much awaited. The launches, however, hinge on the regulatory clearances for the company's Indore and Goa manufacturing facilities, by the USFDA.\n\nThe outcome of inspections at the Indore unit is expected very soon and if the USFDA clears the plant, launch of Advair generics may happen in the ongoing quarter itself. However, if the company fails to get clearance for Indore unit soon, the launch of Advair generics can get delayed by a year also as company may have to opt for site transfer and the USFDA needs to approve the launch of Advair generics from alternative manufacturing facility that is compliant with FDA's current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) requirements.\n\nHowever, for Abraxane generics the company already has filed for site transfer from the Goa facility to a partner's site and the launch may thereby happen by the second half of FY24.",

            "body": "Patient dosing initiated for Phase 2b study of PUR1900 for ABPA\n\nPhase 1 study of PUR3100 for migraine achieves positive topline results\n\n$30.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1 2023 providing projected cash runway into Q4 2024\n\nLEXINGTON, Mass., May 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pulmatrix, Inc. (NASDAQ: PULM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary and central nervous system disease using its patented iSPERSE technology, today announced first quarter financial results for 2023 and provided a corporate update on its development programs.\n\nTed Raad, Chief Executive Officer of Pulmatrix commented, \"Our focus in the first quarter was to advance both PUR1900 and PUR3100. We initiated patient dosing for the PUR1900 Phase 2b study in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This is an important milestone for PUR1900 which has the potential to be the first product approved for treatment of ABPA, a disease with high unmet need that affects more than 300,000 patients in the United States .\" Mr. Raad continued, \"We also announced topline results for a Phase 1 study of PUR3100, our orally inhaled formulation of dihydroergotamine (DHE) being developed for the treatment of acute migraine. Based on these Phase 1 results, we are eager to advance PUR3100 into Phase 2 and plan to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) in mid-2023. We anticipate that PUR3100 will be Phase 2 ready by mid-year so that we are well positioned for potential partnership discussions. While we advance all of our programs clinically, we have been keenly focused on driving operational efficiencies and have extended our projected cash runway from second quarter 2024 into the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 and Recent Program and Corporate Highlights\n\nPUR1900\n\nPUR1900 is currently in a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of ABPA in patients with asthma (NCT05667662). In February 2023, Pulmatrix began dosing patients for its proof-of-concept Phase 2b study of PUR1900 (itraconazole, administered as a dry powder for inhalation). This Phase 2b trial is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study to evaluate PUR1900's efficacy and safety. The multi-center study is being conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and France . Endpoints include safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy outcomes to identify potential registrational endpoints in adult patients with asthma and ABPA. Pulmatrix expects to report topline data from this study in mid-2024.\n\nPUR3100\n\nPUR3100 is under development as an orally inhaled dihydroergotamine (DHE) engineered with iSPERSE for the acute treatment of migraine. On January 4, 2023, Pulmatrix announced PUR3100 was well-tolerated and there was a lower incidence of nausea and no vomiting was observed in PUR3100 dose groups compared to intravenously (IV) administered DHE. The study also showed that PUR3100 achieved peak exposures in the targeted therapeutic range and time to maximum concentration occurred at five minutes after dosing at all dosing levels. Pulmatrix plans to present the data at an appropriate upcoming scientific conference.Based on the rapid systemic exposure in the therapeutic range and the improved side effect profile compared to IV dosing, Pulmatrix believes the PUR3100 formulation of DHE will be differentiated from other products approved or in development. Pulmatrix believes that PUR3100's potential for convenient self-administration and a pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated in studies to date could address unmet needs for patients with acute migraine.Pulmatrix plans to submit an IND in mid-2023 for a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical study of PUR3100 in patients with acute migraine. The Phase 2 study would assess the safety and effectiveness of two dose levels of PUR3100, selected based on the initial Phase 1 clinical study. Initiation of the Phase 2 study is pending potential financing or partnership.\n\nPUR1800\n\nIn February 2023, Pulmatrix presented complete results from a Phase 1b study of PUR1800 for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). The topline data was initially announced in March 2022, at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology annual conference. The completed data analysis is expected to inform the study design of a potential Phase 2 study in patients with AECOPD. Pulmatrix plans to pursue partnership opportunities to advance PUR1800 into a potential Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Financial Results\n\nRevenues increased $0.3 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The increase is related to the Company's revenues recognized in accordance with the Cipla Agreement during the period.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased $0.2 million to $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The decrease was primarily due to decreased spend of $0.6 million in costs related to the Company's PUR3100 program and $0.3 million in costs related to the Company's PUR1800 program, partially offset by increased spend of $0.6 million in costs related to the Company's PUR1900 program.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The increase was primarily due to increased legal and professional services costs.\n\nPulmatrix's total cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2023 was $30.8 million . The Company anticipates that its cash position is sufficient to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nPULMATRIX, INC.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2023\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2022\n\n(unaudited)\n\nAssets\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n30,753\n\n$\n\n35,628\n\nRestricted cash\n\n153\n\n153\n\nAccounts receivable\n\n740\n\n1,298\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n1,154\n\n1,068\n\nTotal current assets\n\n32,800\n\n38,147\n\nProperty and equipment, net\n\n203\n\n235\n\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\n\n685\n\n710\n\nLong-term restricted cash\n\n1,472\n\n1,472\n\nOther long-term assets\n\n899\n\n389\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n36,059\n\n$\n\n40,953\n\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n578\n\n$\n\n1,188\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n\n1,662\n\n1,638\n\nOperating lease liability\n\n779\n\n857\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n1,713\n\n1,339\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n4,732\n\n5,022\n\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\n\n4,317\n\n4,822\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n9,049\n\n9,844\n\nStockholders' equity:\n\nPreferred Stock, $0.0001 par value - 500,000 shares authorized; 6,746 shares designated Series A convertible preferred stock; no shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value - 200,000,000 shares authorized; 3,652,285 and 3,639,185 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively\n\n-\n\n-\n\nAdditional paid-in capital\n\n304,934\n\n304,585\n\nAccumulated deficit\n\n(277,924)\n\n(273,476)\n\nTotal stockholders' equity\n\n27,010\n\n31,109\n\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n\n$\n\n36,059\n\n$\n\n40,953\n\nPULMATRIX, INC.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\n(unaudited)\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nRevenues\n\n$\n\n1,499\n\n$\n\n1,160\n\nOperating expenses:\n\nResearch and development\n\n3,874\n\n4,149\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n2,210\n\n1,974\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n6,084\n\n6,123\n\nLoss from operations\n\n(4,585)\n\n(4,963)\n\nOther income (expense):\n\nInterest income\n\n222\n\n1\n\nOther expense, net\n\n(85)\n\n(11)\n\nTotal other income (expense), net\n\n137\n\n(10)\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(4,448)\n\n$\n\n(4,973)\n\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted\n\n$\n\n(1.22)\n\n$\n\n(1.51)\n\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n\n3,650,769\n\n3,297,280\n\nAbout Pulmatrix, Inc.\n\nPulmatrix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary diseases and central nervous system (\"CNS\") disorders using its patented iSPERSE technology.

Revenue from its mainstay pharmaceutical business climbed nearly 7% to 55.36 billion rupees, while revenue from new ventures more than doubled to 2.34 billion rupees.\n\nCipla, which also makes anti-allergic drug Cetirizine, said revenue from its drugs business in India rose 3.5%, while revenue from its North American market surged 39%.\n\nCipla's profit growth had outpaced its revenue growth in the second and third quarters, helped by a smaller rise in operating expenses.\n\nThe company's EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded to 20.5% from 14.5% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Mumbai-based company expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA margin between 23%-24% in the financial year 2024, Cipla's Global Chief Executive Officer Umang Vohra said in a post-earnings call.\n\nCipla's peer Dr Reddy's Laboratories posted a jump in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, while Lupin Ltd swung to a profit from a loss last year.\n\n($1 = 81.7800 Indian rupees)\n\n(Reporting by Rama Venkat in Bengaluru; Editing by Sohini Goswami)",

MSCI decided to offload two of Adani Group stocks as well.\n\nApart from Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, MSCI reduced the weights of Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, and Mphasis, according to The Economic Times report. The weights of Reliance Industries, Bajaj Finance, Hindalco Industries, Bharat Petroleum Corp, JSW Steel, Divi's Laboratories, ICICI Bank, HDFC Ltd, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Hindustan Unilever, Shree Cement, and Axis Bank were also cut.\n\nMSCI reduced Infosys' weight by 22 basis points which will result in net outflows of $134 million. RIL's weight has been reduced by 26 basis points, which will see net outflows of about $155 million, BPCL's weight has been cut by just 6 bps, which may trigger outflows of about $38 million.\n\nThe exit of Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas from the MSCI Global will result in an outflow of $201million and $186 million. While the cut in weights of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and HDFC will lead to cumulative outflows of a little over $200 million, as per the Nuvama Alternative Quantitative Research estimates. The resultant total net outflow will likely be around $1 billion.\n\nHowever to replace the 15 stocks whose weights were reduced, MSCI increased the weightage of eight index stocks namely, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Power Grid Corp of India.\n\nKotak Bank was increased by 135 bps in terms of the weightage, which alone will bring net inflows of over $800 million.The increase in the weight of other index stocks will result in net inflows of around $400 million.\n\nApart from the index stocks, Zomato, YES Bank, Samvardhana Motherson, and TVS Motor also saw an increase in their weights. Zomato's weight has been increased by 10 bps, which may see FII inflows of around $60 million.\n\nMORE MSCI NEWS Top Adani Energy Stocks To Buy With Bearish Market, Given Upto 168% Soaring Return In 1 Year MSCI Rejig: 7 Stocks Including Tata Power To Find Place In Sensex, Zomato To Be A Large-Cap Stock MSCI World Index: HDFC MF Launches First International Fund MSCI Semi-Annual Index Review: Adds 6 Stocks To India Index, 33 To Small Cap Index-Complete List Adani's 3 Companies May Be Included In MSCI India Index In May Bharti Airtel Up 5% On Possible Weightage Increase In MSCI Index MSCI Global Standard Index Rejig Effective Today 2 Indian Stocks Removed From MSCI Index In Semi-Annual Review, 12 Stocks Added MSCI to Tweak FOL In Indian Stocks; Huge Foreign Funds Expected Muthoot Finance Shares May Be Included In MSCI India Index After 70% Jump This Year MSCI India Index Revision Becomes Effective; 8 Stocks Added Why Do Changes In MSCI Index Matter To Indian Stocks?

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices opened lower on Friday as investors await key retail inflation data, due later in the day. Domestic market sentiments also took a hit after data suggested a possible slowdown in the US economy.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex was trading 246.85 points lower at 61,657.67 at around 9:26 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 was down 76.40 points to 18,220.60. Broader market indices also fell sharply in early trade, following a spike in volatility.\n\nMost major sectoral indices fell in early trade, with metal, IT, media and oil & gas stocks suffering the most. Auto stocks were the only bright spot, rising almost 1 per cent.\n\nThe top gainers on the Nifty 50 were Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp Limited, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Cipla and Tata Motors. On the other hand, the top drags were Divi's Laboratories, Hindalco, BPCL, JSW Steel and Tata Steel.\n\nAlso Read | Sensex, Nifty end lower as dull earnings offset upbeat US CPI data\n\nDomestic markets are likely to witness some volatility in today's trading session as investors wait for April CPI-based inflation data, which will be released at 5:30 pm. Economists have predicted inflation in April to be below 5 per cent, on account of moderation in some food and vegetable prices.\n\nIf inflation falls and remains within the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit for the second consecutive month, it could provide a big boost to domestic markets on Monday.\n\nOn the other hand, global cues remain shaky as recent US data suggests that the economy could face a slowdown. There are also rising concerns over the possibility of a default, arising out of a debt ceiling issue.\n\nWhile the Q4 earnings season played a significant role in supporting the domestic markets over the past month, the momentum will depend on a host of macroeconomic factors and global economy going forward.",

            "body": "The tiny Baltic nation of Lithuania is connected to India not just through linguistic affinities with Sanskrit but also through the people who have set foot here.\n\nOver four centuries, six intrepid Lithuanians have arrived in India, drawn by a zeal to preach, teach or travel, or by friendship or love. They came by sailboat, train and motorbike.\n\nAnd now they are revisiting our shores together via a comic book, titled First Lithuanian Travelers in India.\n\n\"We are completing 10 years of renewed cultural ties, marking the time since a seminar exploring the links was held in Kolkata in 2013. Two of the six characters in the book -- Schlomith Flaum and Antanas Poska -- have links with Bengal. So we thought of bringing it here after the launch in Delhi yesterday,\" Diana Mickeviciene, Lithuania's ambassador to India, said at Arts Acre in New Town on Thursday.\n\nThe conference, she said, threw up interesting material on the intellectual exchanges between prominent figures from the two countries.

            "body": "COVID-19 snarled the US healthcare supply chain, but it was in trouble long before, experts say.\n\nWhat's more, drug and medical-device shortages could get worse, Tammy Beckham, DVM, PhD, associate director of the US Food and Drug Association's (FDA's) Resilient Supply Chain Program at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), told attendees at this month's MedCon 2023.\n\n\"Shortages and supply chain issues don't just happen during a public health emergency,\" she said at the event, which was sponsored by the Association of Food and Drug Officials, the Regulatory Affairs Professional Society, and the FDA. \"We've seen these before COVID, and we're continuing to see these moving into the future. Many of the issues we're facing are becoming much more complex and more systemic.\"\n\nProblems that have plagued the healthcare industry for years, including scarce raw materials, sole-source suppliers, a concentrated market, quality problems and product recalls, labor issues, geopolitical conflict, and natural disasters won't go away with the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nBut Beckham said that CDRH is taking action in three areas to mitigate drug shortages:\n\nEurope, as well as many other regions of the world, is also struggling with maintaining a steady flow of drugs such as antibiotics and generic medicines.\n\nThis month, 19 European Union (EU) member states issued a four-page report on a steady increase in drug shortages since 2022. The report cites problems such as increased demand, manufacturing and quality problems, factory closures, and supply-chain bottlenecks.\n\n\"In addition to these problems, the EU is becoming increasingly dependent on imports from a few manufacturers and regions for its medicines supply, adding a security dimension to the question,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe EU has already taken actions such as creating legislation designed to improve national and European Medicines Agency oversight and mitigation of drug shortages, establishing a steering group to track the causes of shortages and monitor supply, and proposing the Critical Medicines Act to support the domestic manufacturer of drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and intermediates for which the EU depends on one country or just a few manufacturers.\n\nDrug shortages and the quality problems that often cause them aren't limited to generic products, as evidenced by ongoing shortages of Adderall, Wegovy, Pluvicto, and others. Recently, the FDA has reported a slew of quality problems at both foreign and domestic plants that produce both generic and brand-name drugs.\n\n\"The FDA is finding problems in manufacturing quality whether the site is new or old, whether it is producing brand or generic drugs, or whether it is run by the product sponsor or their contractor,\" Pink Sheet reports.\n\nFor example, on April 26, the FDA issued an eight-observation report listing quality-unit failures and controlled-document oversight, on Iceland's Alvotech facility, which manufactures the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. After a March inspection, the FDA released a 10-observation report on Lupin's Pithampur, India, facility that cited unreported out-of-specification results and critical equipment breakdowns.\n\nBased in the same Indian city, Cipla in March received an eight-observation report on its manufacturing plant related to microbiological contamination, power failures, and patient complaints. In Germany, Rentschler Biopharma SE's intermediate manufacturing plant in Baden-Wurttemberg was cited for inadequate prevention of microbial contamination and too-infrequent endotoxin monitoring of some point-of-use equipment.\n\nIn the United States, Eli Lilly's Technology Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, was given a three-observation report citing insufficient aseptic technique and surface sanitization done with soiled wipes.\n\nIn 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Indian manufacturer Maiden Pharmaceuticals sold cough syrups that contained the deadly poisons ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, which are used to make antifreeze, brake fluids, and other products.\n\nThe contaminated cough syrups were linked to the deaths of more than 70 children in Gambia, most of whom were younger than 5 years and died of acute kidney injury.\n\nNow, Reuters reports that an unnamed middleman in Mumbai sold a crucial raw material used to make the cough syrups. Corrupt people can substitute these adulterants for propylene glycol, a key ingredient in syrupy medications, because they can be less than half as expensive.\n\nIn December, India's drug regulator told the WHO that the propylene glycol used to make the cough syrups were supplied by Delhi-based Goel Pharma Chem, who imported it from South Korea's SKC Co. Goel Pharma owner Sharad Goel said he bought the ingredient in sealed barrels from a Mumbai importer who procured it from SKC but couldn't name the importer, according to Reuters.\n\nUnfortunately, the Maiden Pharmaceuticals poisoning was not unique. \"In fact, the death of over 100 patients in the United States in the 1930s due to diethylene glycol contamination led to the creation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires proof of safety for new drugs on the market,\" said David Margraf, PharmD, PhD, pharmaceutical research scientist at the Resilient Drug Supply Project (RDSP).\n\nRDSP is part of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News.\n\n\"The lack of transparency in the global drug supply chain is a major concern that impacts drug shortages and life-threatening quality issues,\" he said. \"It is essential to identify vulnerabilities within the supply chain to ensure safe and effective drugs.\"",

The numbers are likely to be driven by low-teens growth in India business, while the US business is expected to grow in high single-digits as strong growth from Revlimid is likely to be partially offset by lower sales from Albuterol.\"\n\nMasdekar added, \"The EBITDA margin is expected to improve mainly driven by a better product mix. Overall, Cipla has a strong product launch pipeline for the US, India & Emerging Markets which is expected to play out well in the future. We will keep a close watch on the upcoming product launches, continued demand in key therapeutic areas, and the management's continued focus on cost optimization measures.\"\n\nFurther, ICICI Direct added that \"revenues are expected to grow 12.3% YoY to ₹5,908 crore, mainly due to expectations of uptrend visible from both domestic formulations (+15%) and US business (+20%). RoW is likely to showcase 12% YoY growth whereas South Africa is expected to degrow 15%.\"\n\nThe brokerage added, \"we expect gRevlimid to show strong volume growth. EBITDA is expected to grow 77.3% YoY to ₹1,329 crore. EBITDA margins are expected to increase 50 bps YoY to 23%. Subsequently, adjusted PAT is likely to double YoY to ₹813 crore.\"",

Traders may be waiting for the CPI inflation data for the month of April scheduled after market hours on May 12.\n\nThe BSE Sensex fell 36 points to 61,905, while the Nifty50 declined 18 points to 18,297 and formed bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was lower than opening levels, but there was higher high higher low formation.\n\n\"Though Nifty is placed at the crucial overhead resistance of 18,300 levels, still there is no indication of any strength required for decisive upside breakout. The formations of Doji/Spinning Top or High Wave candle patterns back-to-back at the hurdle signal possibility of reasonable downward correction ahead,\" said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities.\n\nHowever, he feels a decisive move above 18,400 levels is likely to change the short term negative sentiment on the positive side. Immediate support is placed at 18,150 levels, he said.\n\nThe broader markets outperformed frontliners, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising third of a percent and half a percent, respectively, on positive breadth, while India VIX sustained uptrend for fifth straight session, increasing by 1.01 percent to 13.22 levels, from 13.08 levels.\n\nWe have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:\n\nNote: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.\n\nKey support and resistance levels on Nifty\n\nThe pivot charts indicate that the Nifty may get support at 18,273, followed by 18,245 and 18,200. If the index advances, 18,365 is the initial key resistance level to watch out for, followed by 18,393 and 18,438.\n\nNifty Bank\n\nThe Bank Nifty extended gains for yet another session, rising 144 points to 43,475 and formed Doji kind of pattern on the daily timeframe, suggesting indecisiveness among traders.\n\nOverall, Bank Nifty had a rangebound trading session during the expiry period. \"The 43,000 levels served as a strong support area with the highest open interest built up on the Put side.

The highest delivery was seen in Atul, Bajaj Auto, Titan Company, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, among others.\n\nAn increase in open interest (OI) and price typically indicates a build-up of long positions.

The topline in the corresponding quarter of the previous year was at Rs 5,260 crore.\n\nStrong traction in the domestic market, coupled with gTrokendi/gRevlimid ramp up, would be the primary contributors to the company's growth.\n\nAccording to global research and broking firm Jefferies, Cipla could also be the biggest beneficiary of a strong flu season in India, which may result in a 12 percent year-on-year growth, with a room for positive surprise.\n\nPhilip Capital also sees room for a positive surprise from Cipla, given the strong operating performance, low base and contribution from gRevlimid, a blood cancer drug.\n\nThe same reason was attributed by several brokerages as the key factor for the expected stellar growth in the domestic market.\n\nThe EBIDTA margin is also likely to expand 506 basis points on year to 19.3 percent for January-March, mainly driven by a better product mix. EBITDA is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nThe Street will also be watching out for the management's commentary on the Indore facility and Advair launch.\n\nOn May 11, the stock closed 0.15 percent down at Rs 943 on the National Stock Exchange.",

            "title": "Cambridge college names building after Cipla chief Yusuf Hamied - GG2",
            "body": "A new residential building named after Dr Yusuf Hamied has opened at Christ's College, Cambridge, where the head of the Indian pharma giant, Cipla, was an undergraduate and then PhD chemistry student between 1954 and 1960.\n\nIn more than 800 years that Cambridge University has been in existence, this is the first time an entire building has been named after an Indian.\n\nThe \"grand opening of Yusuf Hamied Court\" at Christ's was presided over by Lord Simon McDonald, the Master of the College, and attracted about 25 leading scientists, mostly chemistry professors.\n\nProfessor Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, a chemistry Nobel Prize winner and a former president of the Royal Society, was also present at the event earlier this month, as well as Dr Anthony Freeling, the acting vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and the chemist Dame Mary Archer, wife of the best-selling novelist Jeffrey Archer.\n\nHamied and McDonald posed for photographs in front of the \"entirely green\" fourstorey building, where the 64 rooms for postgraduates and fellows from around the world will rely on heat exchangers, instead of gas.\n\nFamous old boys at Christ's include the Paradise Lost poet John Milton, whose mulberry tree in the College gardens still bears fruit that is turned into \"delicious marmalade\"; Charles Darwin, author of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (schoolboys are told that basically \"man descended from monkeys\" much to the fury of religious creationists); and the Indian botanist and physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose, who invented radio waves before Guglielmo Marconi, but chose not to patent his discovery.\n\nThe building was funded by the charitable foundation set up by Hamied and his wife, Farida.\n\nMcDonald, who was previously the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and head of the diplomatic service, said: \"This is really Yusuf Hamied's project. Yusuf has had the longest connection to Christ's since Lord (Alexander) Todd (a Nobel prize winner and former Master of Christ's) turned up in Bombay in the mid-1950s and saw promise in a 17- year-old he met there.\n\n\"And ever since then, Yusuf has had a close connection to the College. So he has the history and the vision and the generosity to make this project happen.\"\n\nProf Frank Kelly, a mathematician who was Master of Christ's from 2006-2016, said: \"Since 2007, the College's graduate numbers have increased from about 70 to around 270, a nearly four-fold increase.... Dr Hamied's humanitarian work is rightly applauded worldwide, and Christ's College is itself greatly honoured by his fellowship. Today, we should acknowledge with gratitude the truly transformative effect he has had on Christ's College in the 21st century.\"\n\nThe Indian high commissioner, Vikram Doraiswami, said he felt he had to come because an eminent Indian \"was being suitably honoured for his contributions in this country. But there is also a personal connection... about 12 years ago, I had the good fortune to screen at the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi the film, Fire in the Blood.\"\n\nThe film reveals how Cipla's cheap antiretroviral drugs saved the lives of millions of AIDS sufferers in Africa. The story was broken by a New York Times journalist, Donald G McNeil Jr, who was also present. He flew to Mumbai to interview Hamied in December 2000, and his \"dollar a day\" report caused a global stir (and upset western pharma giants who attacked Hamied as a \"pirate king\" as he had undercut their sky high prices) when it appeared on the front page of the New York Times on February 7, 2001.\n\nDoraiswami said: \"For those of you who have not seen this documentary directed by a Canadian filmmaker, Dylan Gray, I do urge you to watch it, because you will understand why I hold Yusuf Hamied in the highest personal esteem.\"\n\nHamied, he remarked, had made a difference to countless lives. \"And that is not something we can all tell our maker - whenever we get to see our maker.\"\n\nHe allowed himself a little joke: \"And in the words of my mother in Bangalore, when I told her that I was coming up for this, she said, 'Please tell him I buy all my medicines only from Cipla.'\"\n\nIn the room were two chemists - Lawford Howells and Bill Stein - who, along with Hamied, were in the \"motley crowd of 100\" who joined Christ's in 1954.\n\nHowells recalled: \"All three of us came up to Cambridge to read natural sciences. Bill and I transferred to chemical engineering. Yusuf continued his research in the department of chemistry. And then (went) back to India with his doctorate.\n\n\"This year, it is 69 years since we began our sojourn in Christ's. Yusuf and Farida plan that in 2024, our 70th anniversary, there will be another [class of ] '54 reunion.\n\n\"Yusuf and Farida, this is your day, a day to officially open this very impressive new building which will carry your name into the future. It will be home for many generations of students to come.\"\n\nHamied was the last to speak: \"My family's association with Cambridge University dates back to 1870, when a grand uncle of mine, Justice Syed Mahmood, studied here at Christ's College.\n\n\"His family founded the Aligarh Muslim University in India, which was based on the same lines as Oxford and Cambridge. In subsequent years, another uncle and cousin also studied in Cambridge.\n\n\"In 1953, we met Prof Alexander Todd he was professor of chemistry at that time. This meeting (in Bombay, now Mumbai) changed the course of my life and destiny.\n\n\"When my father asked Prof Todd as to what were the minimum requirements for admission to Cambridge, he replied that 'if we find the candidate suitable, we take him'. So my father said, 'I'd like my son to study at Cambridge.' Todd turned around to me and asked, 'How old are you?' I said, '17, sir.' 'When will you be 18?' 'In July 1954.' 'Right, you're in Christ's College from October '54.'\n\n\"Little did I imagine at that time that 69 years later, I would be standing here in my beloved College in front of this august audience at the inauguration of the Yusuf Hamied Court, connected to the Todd building, where the spirit of education and benevolence are linked together for eternity.\n\n\"In these twilight years of our lives, we cannot imagine a greater honour. It is an occasion that Farida and I will cherish for the rest of our lives.\"",

            "title": "Mankind Pharma rallies 32% on day 1",
            "body": "Mumbai: Mankind Pharma made a strong stock market debut on Tuesday with the stock listing 20% above its initial public offering price of ₹1,080. The stock, which listed at ₹1,300 apiece, ended at ₹1,424, nearly 32% higher than the offer price. Analysts remain bullish about the stock's prospects but recommend traders locking in profits for now.\n\nAt Tuesday's closing price, Mankind Pharma was valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 43 times its FY22 earnings. Mankind is now India's fifth largest pharma company by market value of ₹57,046 crore. Sun Pharma, Divi's Lab, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Cipla are currently valued between ₹75,284 crore and ₹2.31 lakh crore.\n\nThe ₹4,326-crore public issue of Mankind Pharma - the biggest IPO in 2023 so far- was subscribed 15.32 times. It was an offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders.\n\nThe IPO was the largest ever by a domestic drug maker since Gland Pharma came up with its ₹6,480 crore public issue in November 2020.\n\n\"The healthcare sector was a laggard over the last one year but started seeing traction over the last two months as the monthly pharma data showed improvement. Mankind received a good response from its anchor clients given its domestic-focused business with strong brand recall in chronic and consumer healthcare segments,\" said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.",

In India, its revenue from generic drugs business climbed 32%.\n\nDr Reddy's consolidated revenue jumped 15.8% to 62.97 billion rupees, while total operating expenses fell 13.3%.\n\nThe company also recommended a final dividend of 40 rupees per share for the financial year 2023.\n\nShares of the company settled 1.3% down at 4,867 rupees on Wednesday ahead of the earnings. They have advanced 14.9% so far this year, outperforming the Nifty pharma index which was up 0.95%.\n\nIts peers Lupin Ltd swung to a profit in fourth quarter from a loss last year, while Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd posted a near-seven-fold increase in quarterly profit.

            "title": "MannKind Stock Jumps On Upbeat Q1 2023 Results (NASDAQ:MNKD)",
            "body": "The company is a Danbury, Connecticut-based biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes inhaled therapeutics for endocrine and rare lung diseases in the United States.\n\nMannKind topped analysts on earnings by $0.01 as the company reported a net loss of $0.04 versus the consensus of -$0.05, and it also topped analysts on revenue by $3.22 million.\n\nMannKind also beat analysts on revenue by $3.22 million.\n\nMichael Castagna, CEO of MannKind Corporation, commented on the results for the first quarter of 2023 and emphasized the strong demand for Tyvaso DPI which led the revenue growth.\n\nMannKind saw revenue increase by nearly 240% year over year to $40.62 million.\n\nA revenue breakdown shows that net revenue from sales of Afrezza -- an inhaled insulin used to improve glycemic control in adult diabetics -- increased 26% year over year to $12.423 million. The company says Afrezza sales have benefited from higher demand and price for the product, as well as a more favorable factor from cartridge mixes.\n\nAfrezza's progress seems quite convincing considering that, as the CEO recalled, sales of this product usually slow at the beginning of the new year.\n\nNet revenue from the sale of V-Go - which was acquired in the second quarter of 2022 and is a portable continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion device for adults with diabetes - was $5.139 million.\n\nIn addition to the above products, revenue from collaborations and services grew 426% year over year to $11.386 million.\n\nRoyalties related to sales of Tyvaso DPI, an inhaled dry powder via single-use prefilled cartridges that Silver Spring, Maryland-based biotech company United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR) launched in the second quarter of 2022, totaled $11.678 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe increase in revenue from collaborations and services was due to the fact that commercial production of Tyvaso DPI did not start in the last quarter of 2022, contrary to expectations. While royalty growth related to the sale of Tyvaso DPI benefited from strong patient demand.\n\nThe company reported a sequential decrease in gross margin on commercial products by 800 basis points to 69% in the first quarter of 2023 as the gross margin of V-Go, which was added in the second quarter of 2022, was lower than that of Afrezza.\n\nAs for total expenses, MannKind reported a 40.2% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2023 to $46.624 million. Total expenses were impacted by higher production activities for Tyvaso DPI, higher costs related to product pipeline development and additional costs incurred during clinical trials of MNKD-101 and of Afrezza for pediatric indications.\n\nMNKD-101 is a nebulized formulation of clofazimine, an antibiotic commonly used in leprosy that the company plans to commercialize as a treatment for severe chronic and recurrent lung infections. These include nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary and cystic fibrosis.\n\nTotal operating expenses were also impacted by promotional activity related to Afrezza and the addition of V-Go in the second quarter, as well as higher stock-based compensation, labor costs and higher professional fees.\n\nAs for the breakdown of total expenses, the cost of goods sold accounted for about 12% of the total expenses, the cost of revenue - collaborations and services for about 23%, the research and development for about 12%, and the selling expenses for about 23% 29%, on general and administrative matters accounted for ≈23%.\n\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2023 totaled ≈$5.2 million and was approximately flat year-on-year. Of this, 45% was due to the operation of a financing liability while the 55% portion was due to fixed-rate debt securities.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the balance sheet reported cash and short-term investments of $166.6 million against total debt of approximately $378 million, of which approximately 5.6% is short-term debt and the remaining 94.4% is long-term debt.\n\nThe company is burning cash, as evidenced by MannKind's weighted average cost of capital of 10.5% compared to MannKind's ROIC of -60.75%, and is in financial distress areas according to the Altman Z-Score of -13.81, which is implying the possibility for a bankruptcy event within the next two years.\n\nHowever, the CEO notes that while cash on hand is down just a few million since the end of 2022, its net loss is down more than 60% year over year to $9.795 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $25.998 million in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe company anticipates that multiple actions to support strong patient demand for Tyvaso DPI will further improve the relationship between the growth engine and cash balance management.\n\nMichael Castagna, CEO of MannKind Corporation, said:\n\n\"I'm excited about our inhaled platform and orphan lung pipeline as we get ready to launch our Phase 2/3 inhaled clofazimine trial for patients in the second half of 2023.\"\n\nAdditionally, a first major Phase 4 trial is expected to begin in a healthcare area called \"Pump Sparing\" involving key opinion leaders from more than 20 countries. This will be a head-to-head comparison of Afrezza to the standard of care, while the enrollment phase for this study is scheduled to take place between June and July 2023.\n\nCatalysts for higher stock prices could also be the results MannKind Corporation expects over the next 12 months from two more studies conducted for Afrezza.\n\nThese studies are the following: the INHALE-1 study, which is being conducted at more than 35 sites. The INHALE-2 study, which the company refers to as the CIPLA Phase 3 study for India, as MannKind Corporation is a business partner of Mumbai-based drugmaker Cipla Limited based on an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement for Afrezza in India.\n\nThe addition of V-Go and strong patient demand for Tyvaso DPI will continue to drive positive revenue momentum in the current quarter and beyond.\n\nThe endocrinology business is expected to benefit from the continued increase in patient co-payments beyond the first quarter of 2023 and to break even by the end of this year.\n\nThe company has modernized its production operations and improved filling and packaging activities to increase supply capacity by more than 200% from the second half of 2023 in light of continued demand growth.\n\nFrom a revenue perspective, the company expects annual revenue of $200 million to $240 million (per 10,000 patients), including collaborative services and royalties, while analysts expect revenue of $175.52 million in 2023 (up 75.92% year over year) and $266.50 million (up 51.83% year over year) in 2024.\n\nShares of MannKind Corporation were trading at $3.80 apiece as of this writing for a market cap of $1 billion.\n\nThe shares are trading much lower than the long-term trend of the 200-day simple moving average of $4.22, the 100-day simple moving average of $4.64 and the 50-day simple moving average of $4.17.\n\nThe 14-day relative strength indicator at 42.31 suggests that the shares are neither overbought nor oversold but are in an uptrend mode.\n\nInvestors should consider taking a position in this stock given the existence of several catalysts that could boost the share price in the period ahead, while current price levels would allow for a modest allocation of funds.\n\nMannKind Corporation has an average Buy rating on Wall Street, which stems from three Strong Buys, one Buy, and one Hold.\n\nAnalysts have also issued a price target of $6.40, which implies an upside potential of +68.42% from current levels.\n\nGiven these estimates of a stock price rise - and the reasons for a new up leg are not in short supply actually - it may be worth taking the risk with MannKind Corporation. Bearing in mind that setbacks in inhalation therapy trials or a demand that does not develop as desired are always possible business outcomes.\n\nMannKind Corporation has released financial results for the first quarter of 2023, which reported an amazing increase in revenue thanks to strong demand for the company's products, particularly Tyvaso DPI.\n\nThe company expects demand to remain robust and against this backdrop has increased the efficiency of its production operations. This should support revenue growth well beyond the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company should begin the Phase 2/3 trial of inhaled clofazimine in patients sometime in the second half of 2023 to evaluate the product as a treatment for severe chronic and recurrent lung infections.\n\nThree clinical trials of Afrezza, which is currently used as an inhaled insulin to improve glycemic control in adult diabetics, should issue readouts in the coming months that could provide additional catalysts for higher MannKind Corporation stock prices.",

            "body": "Mumbai: Mankind Pharma made a strong stock market debut on Tuesday with the stock listing 20% above its initial public offering price of ₹1,080. The stock, which listed at ₹1,300 apiece, ended at ₹1,424, nearly 32% higher than the offer price. Analysts remain bullish about the stock's prospects but recommend traders locking in profits for now.\n\nAt Tuesday's closing price, Mankind Pharma was valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 43 times its FY22 earnings. Mankind is now India's fifth largest pharma company by market value of ₹57,046 crore. Sun Pharma, Divi's Lab, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Cipla are currently valued between ₹75,284 crore and ₹2.31 lakh crore.\n\nThe ₹4,326-crore public issue of Mankind Pharma - the biggest IPO in 2023 so far- was subscribed 15.32 times. It was an offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders.\n\nThe IPO was the largest ever by a domestic drug maker since Gland Pharma came up with its ₹6,480 crore public issue in November 2020.\n\n\"The healthcare sector was a laggard over the last one year but started seeing traction over the last two months as the monthly pharma data showed improvement. Mankind received a good response from its anchor clients given its domestic-focused business with strong brand recall in chronic and consumer healthcare segments,\" said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\n\nREAD SOURCE",

Drugmaker Cipla has in-licensed Stempeucel-DFU to market in the country.\n\nThe study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre, single-dose study assessing the efficacy and safety of peri-ulcer administration of Stempeucel-DFU, the company said. About 84 patients were recruited in this study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomised into either the stemcell arm or placebo arm in a ratio of 1:1, it added. As a result, 42 patients received Stempeucel-DFU drug, and 42 patients received the placebo.\n\nAlso read: Mankind Pharma listing: India-first premium to the fore\n\nThe drug is administered through intramuscular/intradermal/subcutaneous route based on the location of the ulcer, it said.\n\nBN Manohar, Stempeutics Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, said, if Phase III results demonstrate durable improvement in ulcer healing, Stempeucel-DFU has the potential to make a major difference in patients with this serious medical condition.\n\nDr Pawan Gupta, Stempeutics President (Medical and Regulatory Affairs), said, the current standard of care for treating non-healing diabetic ulcer included wound care with sterile dressings, repeated debridement of necrotic tissues and pressure off- loading. \"Most results are unsatisfactory, and about 20 percent of patients with DFU undergoe limb amputation.\" Cell therapy has its advantages compared to other modes of treatment, as it secretes various cytokines / growth factors that are shown to orchestrate various steps of the wound healing process, he added.\n\nJaideep Gogtay, Cipla Global Chief Medical Officer, said, \"DFU is a serious condition requiring immediate treatment to re-establish blood-flow to the affected area to prevent the leg from amputation.\" The novel treatment by Stempeucel-DFU will equip physicians in India to treat DFU and will improve the quality of patient lives, he added.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 9, 2023",

            "title": "Nifty at 18,000: How different is the market now versus October 2021?",
            "body": "Indian equities finally managed to reverse their three-month-long losing streak, with bellwether Nifty50 breaking 18,000 levels for the second time this year. Its attempt to scale beyond 18000 levels since October 2021, when it scaled this milestone the first time, did not meet much success except for the second half of 2022. Since the beginning of 2023, the index has been on a slippery path.\n\nWhile the rally's sustainability remains to be seen, the Nifty 50 has recovered by over 7 per cent from its March 2023 low level of 16,950. Interestingly every time the market has tried to move past 18,000 levels, it has been quite a struggle for the market, given the global recessionary concerns, inflation worries, rate hikes and other adverse geopolitical developments.\n\nBut what has changed between October 2021, when Nifty first breached 18,000? Which stocks have aided the rally this time and then?\n\nThe October 2021 rally was largely led by banking stocks such as HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, ruling at new highs then. Banking stocks got a boost from the hopes of economic recovery and credit growth improvement, post easing of covid related curbs.\n\nStocks such as ITC and auto majors such as Maruti failed to participate in the 2021 rally, thanks to the post covid impact and high raw material prices as food and other industrial commodity prices hit the roof in 2021-22.\n\nInterestingly, the Nifty's journey this time has been driven by the stocks that did not participate in the 2021 rally. To understand the contributors to this rally, we have considered the prices of Nifty stocks now (as of 3 May 2023), their 52-week high price and price as on 13 October 2021.\n\nOur analysis reveals that of the 50 stocks that are part of the Nifty 50, 17 stocks, constituting about a third of the index, are trading close to their 52-week high price, with the deviation being under 5 per cent. Topping the list is the stock of drug maker Dr Reddy's Laboratories and ITC Limited. Other stocks include Nestle India, Bajaj Auto, HDFC twins, and Tata Motors. PSU stocks have contributed to the rally this time, including ONGC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Power Grid Corporation and NTPC. In terms of themes that have led the rally this time, it is FMCG, Oil and Gas, PSU stocks and in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and banking, it is specific stocks that have aided the rally, instead of a broad-based rally, covering all stocks in the sector. For instance, While Dr Reddy's is trading close to its 52-week high price, Cipla is about 22 per cent off its one-year high price. Likewise, in banking while ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have done well, Axis Bank is about 11 per cent off its year high. IT, a significant contributor to the Nifty rally in October 2021, has been a laggard this time. Infosys and Wipro are trading at a steep 24 per cent discount to their one-year high price, while TCS has managed to contain the downside relatively well trading 11 per cent lower than its 52-week high levels.\n\nAdani Enterprise is at the bottom, trading 56 per cent below its year-high price. Others include Adani Ports (32 per cent lower), Divi's Laboratories (29 per cent), Bajaj Finserv (27 per cent) and Infosys (24 per cent).\n\nRally not broad-based\n\nWhile Nifty is the key index the country tracks, what is the broad market trend? To understand this better, we have analysed the data of the top 500 listed stocks.\n\nOf the top 500 stocks, about 88 of them are trading about 5 per cent off their year highs. Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Bajaj Auto and Bosch Limited are topping this list. Others in the top 10 stocks close to their 52-week highs include, Alkem Laboratories, HDFC Ltd, Oracle Financial Services, ITC, and Power Finance Corporation. Besides PSUs, several oil and gas companies, including city gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas, are featured in the list, with the current price close to about 5 per cent off its peak. Besides large banks, small finance banks - AU Small Finance Bank also features in the list. While large IT has underperformed market, mid and small IT companies have still managed to do well and buck the weakness, with several of them still trading close to their year highs, including names such as KPIT Technologies, Cyient Ltd and Sonata Software.\n\nAbout 72 stocks are trading 5-10 per cent lower than their year-high prices, while 133 stocks are trading 10-20 per cent lower than their 52-week high prices. About 208 stocks are trading at a 20-88 per cent discount to their 52-week highs.\n\nAmong those trading off their year highs, top on the list is Brightcom Group (88 per cent), Adani Total Gas (76 per cent), Adani Transmission (76 per cent), Adani Green (67 per cent), Tata Tele services (59 per cent) and Gland Pharma (58 per cent) among others. About 13 stocks are trading at over half their October 2021 prices.\n\nOf the 500 stocks, 17 stocks were listed after October 2021. Out of the balance 483 stocks, 213 stocks are trading at prices higher than the October 2021 levels; of these, about 19 stocks have doubled since October 2021. Stocks that have delivered the most since October 2021 include RVNL, Lloyds Metals, Raymond, and several defence stocks such as Mazagon Dock, Bharat Dynamics, and Hindustan Aeronautics. About 20 stocks are trading at half the prices seen in October 2021. About 270 stocks are trading at levels below the October 2021 levels. This points to the fact that the market rally is not broad-based but driven by select themes such as PSU, Oil and gas and FMCG.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 8, 2023",

It is also broadly in line with consensus estimates.\n\nIndia Industrial Production (YoY) (March)\n\nIndia's annual industrial output rose 5.6% in February from a year earlier helped by growth in manufacturing and electricity generation.

            "body": "Bulls have had a good time since last month in Dalal Street due to continued buying by foreign investors and better corporate earnings. However, a series of events, economic data points, and earnings are due next week, resulting in some likely volatility in markets despite the positive trend. The coming week will include a review by the Bank of England and earnings releases by many Indian companies, along with various macro data points and an MSCI index review. Additionally, investors will watch the primary market as Mankind Pharma is expected to debut.Barring the fall seen on Friday, Dalal Street bulls have had a good time since the last month due to continued buying by foreign investors and largely better corporate earnings.\n\nThe overall trend for the market remains positive, but a series of events, economic data points, and earnings are due next week.\n\nTherefore, some volatility in the markets is likely, according to market participants.\n\n\"Although domestic undertone remains bullish, markets may remain choppy and move in tandem with the global mood,\" said Amol Athawale, technical analyst at Kotak Securities.\n\nHere are the 8 major factors that will drive both bulls and bears on Dalal Street next week:\n\nGlobal Markets\n\nIn early trade, domestic equities will take cues from the trend in global markets. A slew of key economic data points are scheduled to be released in the US, UK, and China. These data points will decide the course of action in the respective markets.\n\nMacro Data\n\nThe consumer price inflation print for April will be released in the US on May 10. Further, the monthly budget statement and initial jobless claims will also be released next week.\n\nIndia will also release its consumer price inflation number for April and industrial production data for March in the coming week.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England is scheduled to meet to review its policy and announce an interest rate decision on May 11. Meanwhile, China will release its trade data on May 9, inflation numbers on May 11, and current account balance on May 12.\n\nQ4 Earnings\n\nThe week ahead will see a plethora of companies releasing their quarterly earnings.\n\nLarsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tata Motors, Cipla, Vedanta, Hindustan Petroleum Corp, Siemens, Godrej\n\nConsumer Products, UPL, Lupin, Pidilite Industries, Canara Bank, Apollo Tyres, and Raymond are a few names.\n\nBesides, companies like Hero MotoCorp, Britannia Industries, Adani Power, and Paytm, which released earnings on Friday, will also see some action in their shares.\n\nCorporate Action\n\nOracle Financial Services stock will trade ex-date on May 9 for the interim dividend of Rs 225 announced by the company.\n\nCoforge and Laurus Labs will trade ex-date for their respective dividends of Rs 19 and Rs 1.20 on May 10.\n\nIndiaMART InterMESH will trade ex-date on May 11 for the Rs 20/share final dividend announced last week.\n\nFII Flows\n\nFrom being the worst-performing market at the start of 2023, India became the best-performing market in April, thanks to the strong foreign institutional money that poured into the domestic market, alongside steady domestic flows.\n\nIn just 7 trading sessions, FIIs have poured $1.9 billion into Indian equities.\n\n\"FPIs are likely to continue buying in India. The appreciation in rupee and good Q4 results will aid in increasing capital flows to India,\" said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nMSCI Rejig\n\nThe MSCI index review for May is scheduled to take place on May 11, and foreign investors will closely track the same to make adjustments to their portfolios.\n\nTwo stocks that will be in focus are Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, as MSCI will reduce the free float for them during the index review.\n\nMSCI sees Adani Total Gas' free float at 14% against 25% earlier. For Adani Transmission, it sees it at 10% against 25% earlier.\n\nFurther, HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation will also be in the limelight as MSCI is expected to add the bank to its largecap segment.\n\nThe addition with an adjustment factor of 0.5 could result in outflows of $150-200 million, according to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.\n\nTechnical Talk\n\nWhile the fall in HDFC twins did weigh on the Nifty 50 and pulled down markets on Friday, the trend hasn't turned bearish. \"We believe that if there is no aberration globally, we may see buying resuming at key supports,\" said Sameet Chavan, head - technical and derivatives, Angel One.\n\nAs far as the levels are concerned, 18000 followed by 17900 are likely to be crucial support levels for the 50-stock index. On the flip side, the sturdy wall once again stands at 18150-18250, Chavan said, adding that it would be interesting to see how things shape up in the first half of the week.\n\nIPO Watch\n\nThe coming week will also have investors' attention in the primary market as Mankind Pharma is likely to debut on Monday, The SME IPOs like De Neer Tools and Innokaiz India will open for subscription next week.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "body": "Based on the OI percentage, 76 stocks, including Chambal Fertilizers, Manappuram Finance, Max Financial Services, Oracle Financial, and Aurobindo Pharma saw a long unwinding.\n\nThe market succumbed to selling pressure with the benchmark indices reversing all their previous day's gains to close with a percent down on May 5. The sharp fall in HDFC twins dented sentiment. Also, as a result, the market closed flat for the week.\n\nThe BSE Sensex on May 5 tanked 695 points to 61,054, while the Nifty50 fell 187 points to 18,069 and formed bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale indicating profit booking as well as selling pressure at higher levels.\n\n\"This market action indicates rejection of bulls at the higher levels. However, the chart pattern also signal bull trap for the market participants, as Nifty failed to sustain above the strong overhead resistance of 18,200 levels on Friday, after sustaining above it on Thursday,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nThe positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is still intact and the present weakness could be in line with the formation of the new higher bottom. Hence, further weakness from here could signal a higher bottom reversal around the next important support of 17,800 levels, he feels.\n\nNifty on the weekly chart formed a small negative candle with a long upper shadow. This chart pattern hints at a possibility of more weakness in the coming sessions, Nagaraj said.\n\nThe broader markets also traded in line with frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 0.7 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell 0.8 percent.\n\nWe have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:\n\nNote: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.\n\nKey support and resistance levels on Nifty\n\nThe pivot charts indicate that the Nifty may get support at 18,052, followed by 18,014 and 17,952. If the index advances, 18,175 is the initial key resistance level to watch out for followed by 18,214 and 18,275.\n\nNifty Bank\n\nThe Bank Nifty was the major loser among indices, falling 1,024 points to 42,661, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily scale.\n\n\"The Bank Nifty has broken the support of the 43,000-42,800 zone. The index if sustained below 43,000 will witness further correction towards the 42,500-42,300 zone, where the next demand area is visible,\" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivatives Analyst at LKP Securities said.\n\nThe upside resistance of 43,000 if taken out decisively will lead to further short covering toward 43,300 levels, he added.\n\nAs per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty may take support at 42,560, followed by 42,322 and 41,938. Key resistance levels are expected to be 43,328, along with 43,565 and 43,950.\n\nCall options data\n\nOn the weekly options front, we have seen the maximum Call open interest (OI) at 18,200 strike, with 1.17 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty in the coming sessions.\n\nThis was followed by 18,300 strike, comprising 76.29 lakh contracts, and 18,100 strike, with more than 74.67 lakh contracts.\n\nCall writing was seen at 18,200 strike, which added 73.72 lakh contracts, followed by 18,100 strike, which added 56 lakh contracts, and 18,800 strike which added 47.11 lakh contracts.\n\nCall unwinding was at 17,500 strike, which shed 18,700 contracts, followed by 17,800 strike, which shed 12,000 contracts, and 17,400 strike, which shed 2,550 contracts.\n\nThe maximum Put open interest was at 18,200 strike with 62.01 lakh contracts, which is expected to act as an important level in the coming sessions.\n\nThis was followed by the 18,100 strike, comprising 61.74 lakh contracts, and the 17,500 strike where we have 58.42 lakh contracts.\n\nPut writing was seen at 17,900 strike, which added 29.28 lakh contracts, followed by 17,800 strike, which added 23.95 lakh contracts, and 18,100 strike, which added 22.63 lakh contracts.\n\nWe have seen Put unwinding at 18,300 strike, which shed 4.93 lakh contracts, followed by 17,700 strike, which shed 2.45 lakh contracts, and 18,400 strike, which shed 1.12 lakh contracts.\n\nA high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Mahindra & Mahindra, Hindustan Unilever, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Cipla, and Maruti Suzuki, among others.\n\nAn increase in open interest (OI) and price typically indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 22 stocks, including MRF, Astral, Indian Energy Exchange, Britannia Industries, and ICICI Bank saw long build-ups.\n\nA decline in OI and price generally indicates a long unwinding. Based on the OI percentage, 76 stocks, including Chambal Fertilizers, Manappuram Finance, Max Financial Services, Oracle Financial, and Aurobindo Pharma saw a long unwinding.\n\nAn increase in OI along with a price decrease indicates a build-up of short positions. Based on the OI percentage, 58 stocks, including Federal Bank, Dabur India, UPL, HDFC Bank, and Gujarat Gas saw a short build-up.\n\n33 stocks see short-covering\n\nA decrease in OI along with a price increase is an indication of short-covering. Based on the OI percentage, 33 stocks were on the short-covering list. These included SBI Card, SBI Life Insurance Company, GNFC, Biocon, and Escorts.\n\nUPL, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Aarti Industries, Apollo Pipes, Birlasoft, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, Craftsman Automation, Exide Industries, Happiest Minds Technologies, HFCL, Kalpataru Power Transmission, Kansai Nerolac Paints, Mahanagar Gas, Pidilite Industries, and VIP Industries will be in focus ahead of quarterly earnings on May 8.\n\nStocks in the news\n\nBritannia Industries: The bakery and dairy products maker has recorded 47.5 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 557.6 crore for quarter ended March FY23, driven by healthy operating performance and topline.

            "title": "Dalal Street Week Ahead: 10 key factors that will keep traders busy",
            "body": "As we will be entering into fifth week of earnings season, over 300 companies are set to announce their quarterly numbers in the week ended May 14.\n\nDomestic benchmark equity indices closed flat in the week ended May 5, after HDFC twins dragged the markets lower in Friday's carnage. The Nifty 50 index rose just 0.02 percent during the week to close at 18,069 while the BSE-Sensex fell 0.10 percent.\n\nThe consolidation came after a solid 2.5 percent gain in both the indices in the week ended April 28.\n\nWhile MSCI tweak for the merged HDFC entity spelt bad news for benchmark indices, some surprise earnings announcements brought cheer to the midcap space in the week gone by. Nifty Midcap 100 advanced 1.1 percent while Nifty Smallcap 100 gained 0.6 percent.\n\nWithin sectors, consumer durables and autos were top gainers while banks and financial services were the top losers.\n\nIn the week ahead, earnings announcements will take centre stage as the much-awaited Fed rate hike event is now behind us.\n\n\"While the overall market structure remains positive, one can expect Nifty to consolidate in the near term on the back of subdued global cues and profit booking in index heavyweights. Next week, market will take cues from ongoing earning season, inflation data and state election outcome,\" Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said.\n\nHere are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy this week:\n\nCorporate Earnings\n\nAs we will be entering into the fifth week of earnings season, over 300 companies are set to announce their quarterly numbers in the week ending May 14.\n\nThe initial January-March 2023 quarter earnings paint a dim picture of corporate profits. Aggregate net sales increased by 14.63 percent YoY, according to a Moneycontrol analysis of 180 companies which have reported earnings for the March quarter, and for which comparable data was available for the preceding 15 quarters. While this is still a notable increase, it is the slowest growth rate since the December 2020 quarter.\n\nAmong the large-cap names, L&T, Asian Paints, Tata Motors, Pidilite, Godrej Consumer Products, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, UPL, HPCL, Avenue Supermarts and Lupin will take prominence. Gujarat Gas, Raymond, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Westlife Foodworld, Balrampur Chini Mills, Siemens and Nazara Technologies will also be key to track.\n\nCPI Inflation\n\nOn May 12, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) will release All India Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers for the month of April. This will likely be the first sub-5 percent print since November 2021, and the lowest print in over 16 months, according to analysts.\n\n\"We expect CPI inflation to continue to moderate in April and forecast headline inflation at 4.8 percent year-on-year, down from 5.7 percent in March. But on a sequential basis, we think stickiness is likely to persist,\" Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays said.\n\nThe RBI's preferred core inflation measure is also seen continuing to inch down, but at a slower pace than headline, he added, falling to 5.3 percent YoY in April from 5.7 percent in March.\n\nUS CPI Inflation\n\nOn May 10, the Bureau of Labour Statistics in the US will release its April Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. The number is expected to ease to 4.9 percent on a yearly basis from 5 percent in March, which was the lowest reading since May 2021.\n\nThe number will give further indication of Federal Reserve's rate action trajectory. On May 3, the Fed delivered its supposedly final 25 basis point rate hike and hinted at a 'hawkish pause'. That said, Jerome Powell left the door open for officials to keep raising borrowing costs if inflation remains more stubborn than they expect.\n\nPrimary Market Action\n\nMankind Pharma, the domestic-focused fourth-largest pharmaceutical company in India, will make its stock market debut on May 9. Its issue size was reduced to 2.8 crore shares from over 4 crore after the company mobilised Rs 1,298 crore through the anchor book. The initial public offering was subscribed 15.32 times, largely on the back of qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).\n\nAs of Friday, Manforce condom-maker's shares were trading in the grey market with a premium of Rs 94. If market sentiment remains strong, the GMP can sustain, resulting in a good listing, said analysts.\n\nAnother big action to track in the primary markets will be India's maiden pure-play retail mall REIT offering. Global private equity major Blackstone Group-backed Nexus Select Trust has set the share's price band for its initial public offering at Rs 95-100 per share, which will open for subscription on May 9 and close on May 11.\n\nFII FlowIn the week gone by, foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree. They bought shares worth Rs 5,527 crore between May 2-5 after buying shares worth Rs 1,997.70 in March and Rs 5,711.80 in April. Favourable domestic macroeconomic data like manufacturing PMI and the GST collections in April helped the FII sentiment, said analysts. On the other hand, domestic institutional investors sold shares worth Rs 2,735 crore, with the bulk of the selling coming on Friday.\n\n\"The domestic market continued to be positive at the beginning of the week, aided by strong FII inflow. We expect continued foreign inflows and favourable domestic macroeconomic conditions to protect the downside,\" according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nOil PricesOil prices fell for the third straight week after Fed rate hike and on concerns that the U.S. banking crisis will slow the economy and impact fuel demand. Additionally, supply increases from some of OPEC members and its alliance weighed on prices. Brent crude closed at $75.30 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate settled closed at $71.34, after hitting lows last seen in late 2021.\n\nLow crude prices are good news for India, as 80 percent of its oil needs come from imports. Crude is also a key raw material for several industries like paint, tyre, pipe and aviation, which stand to benefit from the low prices. Experts expect crude oil will likely consolidate in the lower range after a recent steep fall in price.\n\nGlobal Economic Data Points\n\nHere are key global economic data points to watch out for next week including Bank of England interest rate decision, UK GDP growth estimates for Q1CY23, China inflation for April, and monetary policy meeting minutes by Bank of Japan:\n\nThe Nifty50 has formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating selling pressure at higher levels, while on the weekly scale, there was a bearish Shooting Star kind of pattern formation, which is generally a bearish reversal pattern but needs confirmation in following sessions.\n\nThe weekly momentum indicator MACD (moving average convergence divergence) still has a positive crossover above the zero line, indicating a buy signal. After the recent rally, the index seems to have entered into consolidation mode, so the psychological 18,000 mark is expected to be immediate support for the Nifty50, followed by 17,800 being crucial support, whereas 17,200-17,300 is likely to be a critical resistance area and if the index sustains above 17,300 then 17,500-17,600 can be next hurdles, experts said.\n\n\"We believe that the uptrend is still intact, and this dip should be used as a buying opportunity. Technically the trend for the Nifty is bullish on the broader time frame and buying on every dip can be a profitable strategy,\" Rohan Patil, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities said.\n\nHe feels the support for the index is placed at 17,800 levels and the upper band of the index is capped at 18,350 - 18,400 levels.\n\nF&O Cues & India VIX\n\nThe maximum Call open interest was at 18,200 strike, followed by 18,300 strike and 18,100 strike, with meaningful Call writing at 18,200 strike, then 18,100 strike, whereas on the Put side, we have seen the maximum open interest at 18,200 strike, followed by 18,100 strike and 17,500 strike, with writing at 17,900 strike, then 17,800 strike.\n\nThe above Options data also indicated that 18,200-18,300 is expected to be a critical resistance area for the Nifty50, with 17,900-17,800 may be acting as crucial support levels with 17,500 being strong support.\n\n\"Strong call writing is seen between 18,000 - 18,200 which indicates strong resistance could be witnessed here from next week. Put writers were relatively absent on account of the fall seen on Friday but 17,900-18,000 seems like a good support area,\" Viraj Vyas, Technical & Derivatives Analyst | Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking said.\n\nWeekly PCR (Put-Call ratio) is at 0.64 which is oversold and suggests a bounce back in the next week., he added.\n\nPer monthly Option data, he said, \"18,000 PE is holding a great deal of open interest, while 18,200 strike is seeing the formation of a high-pressure zone (Strike PCR 0.99) which indicates it is a crucial resistance for the index to overcome.\"\n\nCorporate Action\n\nOracle Financial Services Software, Ramkrishna Forgings, Coforge, Laurus Labs, IndiaMART InterMESH, Kewal Kiran Clothing, 360 ONE WAM, and Aptus Value Housing Finance India will trade ex-dividend from next week onwards, while Welspun India will turn ex-buyback next week.\n\nHere are key corporate actions taking place in the coming week:",

            "title": "FII flows, Inflation, IIP data, Q4 results among major key factors to dictate markets in week ahead",
            "body": "Indian equities witnessed a volatile week from May 2nd to 5th on the back of sharp selling in banking and financial stocks after the MCSI plan for HDFC and HDFC Bank fueled fears of funds outflow in the merged entity. HDFC twins lost around ₹64,000 crore of market cap in 1 day. In the week ahead, macroeconomic data coupled with foreign funds flow, major Q4 earnings, and global trends will dictate markets trend. The performance of key segments like auto, FMCG, energy, IT, and banks will be keenly watched.\n\nIn the holiday-shortened week from May 2nd to May 5th, Sensex and Nifty 50 closed with an upside of nearly 1%.\n\nOn Friday, Sensex shed 694.96 points or 1.13% to close at 61,054.29, while Nifty 50 plummeted by 186.80 points or 1.02% to finish at 18,069. HDFC and HDFC Bank recorded heavy losses on Friday with a downside of nearly 6% each.\n\nHowever, overall, the weekly drop is nearly 3% in HDFC Bank and that of HDFC is over 2%. Sensex gained 443 points or 0.7%, and Nifty 50 surged by over 171 points or 0.96%.\n\nAjit Mishra, VP - of Technical Research, at Religare Broking said, \"Markets settled almost unchanged in a volatile week amid mixed signals. Initially, the tone was positive, which further strengthened on the weekly expiry day however a sharp cut in the HDFC twins on the final session erased all the gains. Consequently, both the benchmark indices, Nifty and Sensex, ended unchanged at 18,069 and 61,054.29 levels respectively.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of sectoral indices, Mishra added that they traded mixed wherein auto, energy, and FMCG posted decent gains while banking, realty, and pharma settled lower.\n\nThe broader indices managed to end higher for yet another week and gained in the range of 0.5%-1.0%.\n\nAlso, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, \"The domestic market continued to be positive at the beginning of the week, aided by strong FII inflow and favorable domestic macroeconomic data. The manufacturing PMI and the GST collection in April were better due to an increase in new business, a strong pickup in consumer demand, and improved supply chain conditions.\"\n\nAs of now, Nair added, \"Half of the Nifty 50 companies announced their results, and the earnings growth of those stocks were below estimates, mainly due to weak performance by IT, metal, and cement stocks. While the results for banks, financials, and auto were better than estimates.\"\n\nHowever, the Geojit expert also said, \"Volatility emerged in the global market due to the FED's concerns over elevated inflation despite softening its language on future rate hikes and the ECB's hawkish policy action.\"\n\nIn his weekly outlook note, Nair said, \"We expect continued foreign inflows and favorable domestic macroeconomic conditions to protect the downside. The Q4FY23 earnings estimate of the Nifty is at 11% YoY; therefore, the next set of results is likely to be better and will support the investor sentiment. In the week ahead, the release of US and Indian CPI inflation data will be keenly watched by the market to get a direction.\"\n\nSimilarly, in the coming week, Mishra said, \"Participants will be eyeing macroeconomic data viz. IIP and CPI for cues on May 12. Besides, the US inflation, which is scheduled on May 10, will also be on their radar.\"\n\nOn the earnings front, Mishra said, \"Dr. Reddy, LT, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Cipla, HPCL, and Tata Motors are some of the prominent names who will announce their numbers during the week.\"\n\nAs per Mishra, markets are likely to spend some time around the current levels, after the sharp slide in the banking index. Meanwhile, rotational buying in other key sectors like auto, FMCG, energy, and IT would continue to offer trading opportunities.\n\nIn regards to Nifty 50, Mishra said, \"17,850 will continue to act as crucial support while the upside seems capped at 18,350 levels.\"\n\nTo investors, Mishra added, \"We thus recommend focusing on stock selection and overnight risk management until Nifty resumes the trend.\"",

            "title": "Cipla's Promising Growth Prospects in India and the US",
            "body": "Cipla has built a strong India franchise and an equally strong US portfolio in the last five years. Post the recovery from Covid lows, the stock has traded at an average 24 times one-year forward earnings, which is the upper end for pharma.\n\nIn February this year, Cipla received eight US FDA observations for its Indore plant, which is expected to delay the launch of gAdvair a lucrative inhalation product. The stock has corrected 14 per cent since and is now trading at 19 times forward earnings. Investors can accumulate the stock at current levels as the growth prospects from India are strong and so is the US-facing pipeline, despite the anticipated delay in launches.\n\nIn 9MFY23, 45 per cent of Cipla's revenue of ₹17,014 crore was derived from India, 25 per cent from North America and 13 per cent each from International Markets and South Africa.\n\nIndia opportunity\n\nThe Indian pharma market is a high-growth market offering 10 per cent yearly growth in the next decade. In February 2020, Cipla organised its India business under the 'One India' initiative. It combined distribution, portfolio planning, switching and expansion under a collective management to leverage market growth, ranging from metros to Tier-6 centres and beyond. Cipla covers the three fast-growing segments in India -- branded prescription, trade generics and consumer health business'.\n\nThe consumer health business is expected to clock revenues of ₹1,100 crore (annualised) in FY23, accounting for 11 per cent of India segment. It reported 16 per cent YoY growth in Q3FY23. In the branded prescription business, the much-coveted chronic sales account for 60 per cent of revenues. Cipla is a leader in respiratory and urology in India and is growing faster than the Indian pharma market (IPM), specifically in anti-diabetes, anti-infectives and cardiac. The brand-building exercise can benefit both the divisions' products.\n\nWith a strong presence in respiratory and anti-infectives, Cipla reported 22 per cent revenue CAGR in FY20-22, driven by Covid sales, and sustained the high base with flat growth in 9MFY23 (12 per cent YoY growth ex-Covid). Starting from FY24, the segment is expected to grow faster than Indian pharma market without the Covid base effect.\n\nThe South African market, where Cipla participates through tenders (20 per cent) and private market, declined by 14 per cent YoY in 9MFY23 on account of channel stocking post-Covid, forex movements and general low growth in the markets. The company expects stronger growth here from FY24.\n\nDifferentiated US portfolio\n\nFrom $100 million average annual run rate in FY18, Cipla reported revenues of $195 million in Q3FY23 ($530 million in 9MFY23) as it expanded its portfolio. Compared to a 'large basket' approach, the company chose to develop differentiated products for the US, which are high value and possess a higher development barrier -- Respiratory products: gProventil (first generic in April 2020) and gBrovana (June 2021), peptides: Icatibant (July 2020), Lanreotide (December 2021), and Leuprolide (November 2022), complex product: gRevlimid (September 2022). These products are differentiated and difficult to manufacture and can generate three times the revenue of a plain generic. The complexity also holds off the excessive competition, which though will manifest in generics, will not be at the level of plain generics.\n\nThe pipeline includes more of the same complex line-up including, gAdvair, four complex inhalation products, one complex product (gAbraxane) and four peptides. It is in this light that the stock corrected on news of observations at the Indore plant, which adds to the Goa plant, already under import alert. gAdvair, which had a decisive date in April 2023, and gAbraxane filed from Goa, may be delayed.\n\nCipla had announced de-risking gAbraxane with a likely launch date by FY25. The combined revenue potential expected from the two may likely decline from $120 million if launched in FY25 to $80 million if launched in FY26, assuming increase in competitionand lower product potential. But even when delayed, the potential of the differentiated portfolio sustains, along with scope for peptide launches.\n\nValuations\n\nCipla has traded at an average of 23 times one-year forward earnings in the last 10 years and at 24 times in the last five years as well. The recent correction to 19 times forward earnings presents an opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock. While the timing of pipeline launches has impacted the stock, the value potential is still large and cannot be ignored. Promising prospects of branded portfolios led by India, also in South Africa and International markets, can sustain high growth despite flat to negative growth in the US in the next two years without notable launches. The expanded EBITDA margin of Cipla (YoY 160 bps expansion to 22.6 per cent in 9MFY23) can be supported by the high-value products already launched in the US and India branded markets.\n\nIndian focused pharma companies trade at average 23 times EV/EBITDA (trailing, includes Torrent Pharma, Alkem, Mankind and Ajanta). Applying a 10 per cent discount to Cipla's India business, and further 50 per cent discount to Cipla's rest of the business (South Africa, International) implies that US business is trading at 5 times EV/EBITDA at the current valuation. This is below even Aurobindo Pharma (8.7 times) which operates a large basket of eroding solid dosages and injectables portfolio geared primarily to the US.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 6, 2023",

            "body": "The defendants were leaseholders of a flat in London in a 'live/work' unit. The freeholder brought proceedings against them for breach of covenant for using the flat only as a residential flat. The judge found that the leaseholders, a barrister and a doctor, carried out some work from home such as preparation of articles and speeches, as well as phone consultations. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that as a matter of interpretation of the planning permission for this unit, live/work meant live and/or work. The lower court judge had indicated that even if the planning permission did require work to be done, it did not require a business to be operated from the premises. However, the Court of Appeal declined to reach a conclusion as to what would qualify as being work in this context and whether it was to be equated with 'business activities'.\n\nAHGR Ltd v Kane-Laverack and another [2023] EWCA Civ 428, 21 April 2023\n\nArbitration\n\nThe claimant purchased slots from a container service operated by a consortium of shipping lines under a vessel sharing agreement (\"MOU\"). The claimant was also in discussions about joining the consortium. The claimant settled an incoming claim from cargo receivers and sought an indemnity from the defendant, purportedly under the arbitration clause in the MOU. The claimant was not a named party to the MOU, although it was a named party to a subsequent consortium agreement. The court held that the claimant had simply purchased slots on the service as a third party. There was no express or implied agreement that the terms of the MOU should apply to the slot purchase agreement. It was agreed that the claimant would join the consortium but at a later date. Agreement in principle to the claimant joining the consortium was a precondition to the claimant purchasing the slots but they were nonetheless separate agreements. A further argument based on estoppel also failed. The claimant could not therefore rely on the arbitration agreement in the MOU, the tribunal had no jurisdiction and the claimant's application under section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (\"AA 1996\") to challenge the award failed.\n\nEmirates Shipping Line DMCEST v Gold Star Line Ltd [2023] EWHC 880 (Comm), 25 April 2023\n\nForce Majeure - Brexit and Covid-1\n\nThe claimant port operator and defendant sea ferry operator entered into an agreement for the defendant to use the port and services in exchange for a fee. The defendant failed to achieve the minimum volume guaranteed under the agreement and was liable for a shortfall payment. It argued that the force majeure clause was applicable as the shortfall occurred for Brexit and pandemic related reasons. It also argued that the claimant was in breach of an express contractual obligation of good faith by failing to approach discussions considering amendments to the minimum volume guarantee (\"MVG\") with an open mind. The claimant's application for summary judgment was successful. The court held that the defendant did not have a real prospect of success with its defence that the claimant had not reasonably considered proposed amendments to the MVG because it had not produced sufficient evidence in support. Likewise, the defendant did not produce sufficient evidence in support of its force majeure position.\n\nPD Teesport Ltd v P&O North Sea Ferries Ltd [2023] EWHC 857 (Comm), 26 April 2023\n\nArbitration\n\nThe claimant, Cipla, made an application under section 68 AA 1996 challenging a partial arbitration award on the basis that the tribunal had failed to consider its duty under section 33 AA 1996 to act fairly and impartially and as a result there had been a serious irregularity affecting the award. Cipla alleged that there was a \"fundamental incompatibility\" between an earlier ruling and the Tribunal's subsequent approach which treated the Figure 1 question in the earlier ruling as being no longer in issue. It said that as a consequence the Tribunal had decided the arbitration on a point that was not raised as an issue or argued. The court held that Cipla was not entitled to and had not proceeded on the assumption that the Figure 1 question was no longer in issue. The onus was on Cipla to prove its case and it had not done so. Each party was given a reasonable opportunity to put its case and there was no breach by the tribunal of its duty to act fairly and impartially.",

Hruby; Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer; SIGA Technologies, Inc.\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez; CEO & Director; SIGA Technologies, Inc.\n\nAdam McCarter; Analyst; Edison Investment Research Limited\n\nWelcome to the SIGA business update call. Before we turn the call over to SIGA management, please note that any forward-looking statements made during this call are based on management's current expectations and observations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.\n\nSIGA does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect events or change circumstances after this call. For a discussion of factors that could cause results to differ, please see the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and its subsequent report on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nThank you for taking the time to join today's call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Dennis Hruby, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Dan Luckshire, our CFO. We are pleased to have this opportunity to provide a business R&D and financial update to our shareholders. We'll then be happy to take questions.\n\nOn our last call, we noted that we expect the company's streak of positive financial performance to continue in 2023, with deliveries of oral TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile being a key driver. With this expectation, we have been proactively building inventory in anticipation of a substantial replenishment order of oral TPOXX for the Strategic National Stockpile.\n\nBased on a series of considerations, we are currently targeting for 2023 approximately $113 million of oral TPOXX deliveries to the strategic national stockpile. These deliveries would occur under the current 19C contract. Additionally, we are targeting approximately $11 million of oral TPOXX deliveries to the U.S. Department of Defense for 2023.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to pursuing U.S. government sales of oral TPOXX, we will also continue to work towards generating revenues in 2023 from deliveries of IV TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile as well as generating international sales of oral TPOXX.\n\nWith respect to the international sales effort, as of March 31, 2023, there were firm commitment orders from 2 European countries for the delivery in 2023 of approximately $8 million of oral TPOXX. Additionally, we are currently engaged in active negotiation to add to this amount. In sum, we will continue to work hard to build on the 2023 international base as the year progresses.\n\nWith an eye towards growth, we continue to make progress on 2 key initiatives: one, the monkeypox observational clinical trials; and two, the PET program for oral TPOXX. At this point, I will turn the call over to Dennis to discuss these 2 important initiatives.\n\nDennis E. Hruby\n\nThanks, Phil. With respect to Mpox, TPOXX has been an essential component of the public health response to the global outbreak. TPOXX has been used to compassionately treat more than 6,900 Mpox cases in the U.S. as well as many cases internationally. 9 clinical trials have been launched to study the use of TPOXX for Mpox, 5 of which are randomized placebo-controlled trials that are sponsored by government agencies or NGOs.\n\nTo date, more than 175 Mpox patients have been enrolled in these trials. While the number of Mpox cases have ebbed over the last series of months in the U.S., the clinical trials continue to enroll a global cross section of patients as they become available. It's worth noting that there has been an uptick in Mpox cases in some locations, a development we will continue to monitor in consultation with government officials.\n\nOverall, I would like to reiterate what we said on prior investor calls in connection with the timing, the ultimate number of participants of the trials. These factors will depend on the path of the Mpox outbreak and the general speed of enrollment. Hence, the timing and the likely ultimate enrollment levels of the trials, especially the randomized placebo-controlled trials continues to be currently unknown.\n\nFor example, it remains to be seen whether there will be any type of Mpox case count increase over the coming summer months in the northern hemisphere to roughly mirror the spike in Mpox case counts last year as the CDC has predicted. As such, given the currently unknown factors, the timing and composition of an FDA submission for an Mpox label for TPOXX remains to be determined.\n\nThat said, it's encouraging to note that the various RCTs are contemplating an aggregation of their data as it is unblended with the idea of potentially reaching sufficient subject numbers for regulatory evaluation.\n\nWhile the short-term path of the Mpox outbreak is uncertain, what we have seen and learned to date indicates there's a high probability that the United States and other countries across the world will have to deal with Mpox cases in future years. It's just unknown as to the ultimate magnitude of cases, the scope of the cases across different communities and whether case levels become consistent or whether case levels come and go periodically. We believe that in most scenarios, there will be a need for TPOXX.\n\nShifting gears, I would like to provide an update on the PEP label expansion program for oral TPOXX. I'm happy to report that the company has recently met enrollment targets for both the immunogenicity trial and the expanded safety trial. As a quick reminder, the Jynneos plus TPOXX immunogenicity trial test subjects as to whether oral TPOXX interferes with Jynneos' vaccination, while the expanded safety trial test the safety of oral TPOXX over a 28-day PEP regimen.\n\nIn contrast, the treatment indication for oral TPOXX is 14 days. Samples are currently being analyzed for both trials. We expect unblended results and data lock for both trials to occur within the next 60 days if everything goes according to schedule.\n\nWith respect to the PEP program, I'd like to note a few things. Based on previous animal challenge experiments and clinical trials, we expect both trials will be successful and supportive for the use of TPOXX for PEP. In the case of an orthopox virus epidemic be it Mpox or smallpox, use of TPOXX for PEP will be important to reduce the morbidity and mortality in the population.\n\nProvided unblinded results from the trials are supportive of a regulatory submission. The next step after sample analysis would be to commence preparation activities for an NDA supplemental submission. For such a submission, we're targeting early 2024. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Dan for a financial update.\n\nDaniel J. Luckshire\n\nThanks, Dennis. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, biggest revenue was approximately $8 million, of which approximately $5 million relates to the sale of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense. This is the third sale of oral TPOXX to the Department of Defense over the past 12 months. The remainder of the first quarter revenues are primarily related to research and development activity.\n\nFor the full year 2023, as noted by Phil in his remarks, the company is targeting revenues of approximately $113 million on sales of oral TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile and revenues of approximately $11 million on sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense. These targets are based on a series of considerations and are subject to change.\n\nIn addition to the targets just mentioned, the company is pursuing deliveries and sales of IV TPOXX to the strategic stockpile under an exercise option in the 19C contract and is also pursuing international sales of oral TPOXX. We have not provided specific 2023 targets for IV TPOXX and international sales because details are still building for these markets.\n\nIn connection with the international sales efforts, as noted by Phil earlier in the call, at March 31, 2023, there are firm commitment orders from 2 European countries for the delivery in 2023 of approximately $8 million of oral TPOXX. Additionally, we are currently engaged in active negotiations to add to this amount.\n\nReturning to the first quarter financial results. Pretax operating loss, which excludes interest income and taxes, was approximately $2 million during the 3 months ended March 31, 2023. Net loss for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was approximately $1 million, and fully diluted loss per share was $0.01.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, the cash balance for the company was approximately $116 million. During the first quarter, SIGA repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $7.5 million.\n\nThis concludes the financial update. At this point, I will turn the call back to Phil.\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nThanks, Dan. As a complement to the operational R&D and financial updates discussed earlier in this call, I would like to highlight that we have announced a special cash dividend of $0.45 a share that will be payable on June 1, 2023, based on a record date of May 16, 2023.\n\nAs background, we continually evaluate the best use of cash, and we are focused on a disciplined process to deploy cash where it can generate the best long-term return for our shareholders. As part of this process, we consider a wide range of possibilities and a wide range of consideration.\n\nTime in place is among the considerations with; one, a strong financial performance over the last series of years; and two, a solid balance sheet, we believe it is an appropriate time to declare a special cash dividend. The implementation of this action reflects confidence that comes from historical financial performance and also reflects optimism about the business going forward.\n\nBefore we shift to Q&A, I'd like to emphasize a couple of context points in connection with the PEP program. First, I want to reiterate that the PEP-based development program represents a growth initiative in that it would provide scientific and regulatory support for any stockpile expansion.\n\nAs stated on prior calls, we believe the current size of the stockpile TPOXX in the U.S. would not be sufficient to treat all of those who would need care in many outbreak scenarios. A lesson from the COVID pandemic, which has been reinforced by the Mpox outbreak is that governments need to be more proactive in addressing the health and societal risks associated with virus families.\n\nSecond, we continue to be focused on transitioning our U.S. contract to a long-term SNS contract that focuses on appropriate size requirements for the TPOXX stockpile as well as smoothing the annual deliveries, which would be critical to supply chain planning and provide a higher degree of financial predictability.\n\nWith this in mind, I want to highlight that we believe the clinical trial results from the PEP program, especially the immunogenicity trial are an important part of long-term contract conversation.\n\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam McCarter from Edison Group.\n\nAdam McCarter\n\nI'd like to hear about the progress that SIGA has been making. Just wanted to hear a little bit more about sort of the -- you mentioned already about the international orders. I just wanted to know whether or not you're getting just a little bit more color around the interest regarding the stockpiling.\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nSure, Adam. So thanks for the question. We are getting, I would say, a mix of certainly countries that are continuing to follow up on the Mpox outbreak and making sure they have drug on board. And I would say we'll see a mix of both existing and new countries this year based on the conversation. So I would anticipate to build some new conversations.\n\nAs we've talked before, we've also been reflecting those conversations back to include smallpox because many of the countries had not thought about that. We're encouraged. We certainly have at least 1 country that looks like it's committing to doing more of a smallpox stockpile than an initial procurement for Mpox, and we continue to have those studies.\n\nSo as Dan said, it continues to evolve, a lot of discussions. It's a slow process as we've seen over time, but encouraged that we still have a growing number of countries we're talking to and starting to be able to also talk about smallpox as well.\n\nAdam McCarter\n\nFantastic. If I could just follow up with another question as well. Just wondering about if you -- just in terms of sort of data comes in our placebo-controlled studies in monkeypox. When can you give any guidance on when we might expect to see some sort of data from those studies coming out in the near term?\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nYes, I can add a little bit. I mean, Dennis talked about this that we have a lot of placebo-controlled studies ongoing, but case levels have come down substantially. Although we have seen, for example, in Japan, there's a slowly growing number of cases that are there.\n\nSo I think there's 2 parts of that driving the time line. One is what is the case load. If we see an increase as we did last spring in cases. I think the good news is there are placebo-controlled studies throughout the world that will try and catch those, both in U.S., Europe, South America, Asia. So there's a lot of work that's been done to set up those studies and try and catch those. But if we don't see the caseload increase, it's going to be hard to do that.\n\nThe second part is, as Dennis highlighted, which is, I think, very important. The groups, which are predominantly governments, places like NIH in the U.S., Oxford University in the U.K. government in the U.K., WHO has helped support some of the studies in Europe.\n\nThey're starting to talk amongst the clinical network and also stock to regulators to make sure whatever data set we have, we can try and pool that, use all of that data to be able to go for approvals. We don't have to wait for 1 study to get to critical mass. So there's been conversations that are encouraging, but we'll have to stay tuned and see where that goes.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joaquin Horton, an Investor.\n\nJoaquin Horton\n\nMy question is, we've been kicking around this PEP program for the last several years. Is there any way you can quantify as to what the size of the potential of this program could be?\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nThanks, Joaquin. I appreciate the question. I hope all is well in retirement for you, and I appreciate you calling in. So there's a couple of ways to answer that question, but the one that we very specifically thought about is the implications for the use of TPOXX for PEP in smallpox, which is that you would go from a 14-day treatment to a 28-day treatment.\n\nCurrently, our contract is for a 1.7 million course requirement. And if you wanted to maintain the ability to treat 1.7 million people with the potential for a lot of those being PEP, you would need to double the amount of drug in the stockpile. So certainly, the initial messaging we've had is at the very least, given the requirements that are already on the books, there's an opportunity to potentially double what the U.S. government buys.\n\nI would also add in 2 kind of other perspectives on that. One is, for those of you that have been following SIGA a very long time, our original contract in 2011 contemplated up to 12 million courses and options, and BARDA cited PEP is one of the reasons they may need more than the 1.7 million. So there has been a long history of evaluating that with even potentially higher numbers.\n\nBut then the other part is the strategic national stockpile has stated repeatedly, including in their multiyear budget, they don't have full funding for all the things they would like to buy. So there'll certainly be a lens of affordability that could evolve over time. So we think the doubling of the stockpile is an important way to think about it immediately and continue to think about the long-term preparedness that we think the U.S. government ultimately should do.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Ralph Weil From R. Weil Investments.\n\nRalph Weil\n\nThank you again for the special dividend and for the confidence you show in purchasing the shares. I have 1 question. Are you -- besides smallpox and Mpox, are you actively involved at this point in working on any vaccine or countermeasure for any other emerging infectious diseases or other attacks, perhaps, bio-defense attacks?\n\nPhillip Louis Gomez\n\nYes. So Ralph, thank you very much for the question. As you've heard, TPOXX is our licensed product with sales. That is by far our lead product. We do have a candidate product that's in preclinical that also has the potential to treat orthopox infection. We are doing some work on that, but it's very early on.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that's a major one. We know the government always want to have 2 products. And the second product that was licensed had a black box warning on it. So we think it's important to continue to think about second-generation products there.\n\nAnd then we do scan for potential products, countermeasures, things that would be in this space to bring on board. We look at the science. We look at the market potential. And we have not brought anything on board to date, but we continue to look at those assets.\n\nWe continue to monitor the antibiotic space at BARDA for RFP, we expect will come probably this next fiscal year, and we have a partnership with Cipla to go after that RFP with an antibiotic they have, but that's, again, a little further off and that's a partnership, not an asset that we have. But we do very actively look at the space and look at things that we could bring on board that would help us bring products either to the government or to the commercial market.\n\nI'd like to thank everybody for joining us at this first quarter conference call. We appreciate your time. We appreciate your support and look forward to continue to create value for our shareholders. So thank you again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

            "body": "Welcome to the SIGA Business Update Call. Before we turn the call over to SIGA management, please note that any forward-looking statements made during this call are based on management's current expectations and observations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.\n\nSIGA does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect events or change circumstances after this call. For a discussion of factors that could cause results to differ, please see the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and its subsequent report on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.\n\nPhil Gomez\n\nThank you for taking the time to join today's call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Dennis Hruby, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Dan Luckshire, our CFO. We are pleased to have this opportunity to provide a business R&D and financial update to our shareholders. We'll then be happy to take questions.\n\nOn our last call, we noted that we expect the company's streak of positive financial performance to continue in 2023, with deliveries of oral TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile being a key driver. With this expectation, we have been proactively building inventory in anticipation of a substantial replenishment order of oral TPOXX for the Strategic National Stockpile.\n\nBased on a series of considerations, we are currently targeting for 2023 approximately $113 million of oral TPOXX deliveries to the strategic national stockpile. These deliveries would occur under the current 19C contract. Additionally, we are targeting approximately $11 million of oral TPOXX deliveries to the U.S. Department of Defense for 2023.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to pursuing U.S. government sales of oral TPOXX, we will also continue to work towards generating revenues in 2023 from deliveries of IV TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile as well as generating international sales of oral TPOXX. With respect to the international sales effort, as of March 31, 2023, there were firm commitment orders from two European countries for the delivery in 2023 of approximately $8 million of oral TPOXX. Additionally, we are currently engaged in active negotiation to add to this amount. In sum, we will continue to work hard to build on the 2023 international base as the year progresses.\n\nWith an eye towards growth, we continue to make progress on two key initiatives: one, the monkeypox observational clinical trials; and two, the PET program for oral TPOXX. At this point, I will turn the call over to Dennis to discuss these two important initiatives.\n\nWith respect to Mpox, TPOXX has been an essential component of the public health response to the global outbreak. TPOXX has been used to compassionately treat more than 6900 Mpox cases in the U.S. as well as many cases internationally. Nine clinical trials have been launched to study the use of TPOXX for Mpox, five of which are randomized placebo-controlled trials that are sponsored by government agencies or NGOs.\n\nTo-date, more than 175 Mpox patients have been enrolled in these trials. While the number of Mpox cases have ebbed over the last series of months in the U.S., the clinical trials continue to enroll a global cross section of patients as they become available. It's worth noting that there has been an uptick in Mpox cases in some locations, a development we will continue to monitor in consultation with government officials.\n\nOverall, I would like to reiterate what we said on prior investor calls in connection with the timing, the ultimate number of participants of the trials. These factors will depend on the path of the Mpox outbreak and the general speed of enrollment. Hence, the timing and the likely ultimate enrollment levels of the trials, especially the randomized placebo-controlled trials continues to be currently unknown.\n\nFor example, it remains to be seen whether there will be any type of Mpox case count increase over the coming summer months in the northern hemisphere to roughly mirror the spike in Mpox case counts last year as the CDC has predicted. As such, given the currently unknown factors, the timing and composition of an FDA submission for an Mpox label for TPOXX remains to be determined.\n\nThat said, it's encouraging to note that the various RCTs are contemplating an aggregation of their data as it is unblended with the idea of potentially reaching sufficient subject numbers for regulatory evaluation.\n\nWhile the short-term path of the Mpox outbreak is uncertain, what we have seen and learned to date indicates there's a high probability that the United States and other countries across the world will have to deal with Mpox cases in future years. It's just unknown as to the ultimate magnitude of cases, the scope of the cases across different communities and whether case levels become consistent or whether case levels come and go periodically. We believe that in most scenarios, there will be a need for TPOXX.\n\nShifting gears, I would like to provide an update on the PEP label expansion program for oral TPOXX. I'm happy to report that the company has recently met enrollment targets for both the immunogenicity trial and the expanded safety trial. As a quick reminder, the Jynneos plus TPOXX immunogenicity trial test subjects as to whether oral TPOXX interferes with Jynneos' vaccination, while the expanded safety trial test the safety of oral TPOXX over a 28-day PEP regimen.\n\nIn contrast, the treatment indication for oral TPOXX is 14 days. Samples are currently being analyzed for both trials. We expect unblended results and data lock for both trials to occur within the next 60 days if everything goes according to schedule.\n\nWith respect to the PEP program, I'd like to note a few things. Based on previous animal challenge experiments and clinical trials, we expect both trials will be successful and supportive for the use of TPOXX for PEP. In the case of an orthopox virus epidemic be it Mpox or smallpox, use of TPOXX for PEP will be important to reduce the morbidity and mortality in the population.\n\nProvided unblinded results from the trials are supportive of a regulatory submission. The next step after sample analysis would be to commence preparation activities for an NDA supplemental submission. For such a submission, we're targeting early 2024.\n\nAt this point, I would like to turn the call over to Dan for a financial update.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, biggest revenue was approximately $8 million, of which approximately $5 million relates to the sale of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense. This is the third sale of oral TPOXX to the Department of Defense over the past 12 months.\n\nThe remainder of the first quarter revenues are primarily related to research and development activity. For the full year 2023, as noted by Phil in his remarks, the company is targeting revenues of approximately $113 million on sales of oral TPOXX to the Strategic National Stockpile and revenues of approximately $11 million on sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense. These targets are based on a series of considerations and are subject to change.\n\nIn addition to the targets just mentioned, the company is pursuing deliveries and sales of IV TPOXX to the strategic stockpile under an exercise option in the 19C contract and is also pursuing international sales of oral TPOXX. We have not provided specific 2023 targets for IV TPOXX and international sales because details are still building for these markets.\n\nIn connection with the international sales efforts, as noted by Phil earlier in the call, at March 31, 2023, there are firm commitment orders from two European countries for the delivery in 2023 of approximately $8 million of oral TPOXX. Additionally, we are currently engaged in active negotiations to add to this amount.\n\nReturning to the first quarter financial results. Pretax operating loss, which excludes interest income and taxes, was approximately $2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was approximately $1 million, and fully diluted loss per share was $0.01.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, the cash balance for the company was approximately $116 million. During the first quarter, SIGA repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $7.5 million.\n\nThis concludes the financial update. At this point, I will turn the call back to Phil.\n\nAs a complement to the operational R&D and financial updates discussed earlier in this call, I would like to highlight that we have announced a special cash dividend of $0.45 a share that will be payable on June 1, 2023, based on a record date of May 16, 2023. As background, we continually evaluate the best use of cash, and we are focused on a disciplined process to deploy cash where it can generate the best long-term return for our shareholders. As part of this process, we consider a wide range of possibilities and a wide range of consideration.\n\nTime in place is among the considerations with; one, a strong financial performance over the last series of years; and two, a solid balance sheet, we believe it is an appropriate time to declare a special cash dividend. The implementation of this action reflects confidence that comes from historical financial performance and also reflects optimism about the business going forward.\n\nBefore we shift to Q&A, I'd like to emphasize a couple of context points in connection with the PEP program. First, I want to reiterate that the PEP-based development program represents a growth initiative in that it would provide scientific and regulatory support for any stockpile expansion.\n\nAs stated on prior calls, we believe the current size of the stockpile TPOXX in the U.S. would not be sufficient to treat all of those who would need care in many outbreak scenarios. A lesson from the COVID pandemic, which has been reinforced by the Mpox outbreak is that governments need to be more proactive in addressing the health and societal risks associated with virus families.\n\nSecond, we continue to be focused on transitioning our U.S. contract to a long-term SNS contract that focuses on appropriate size requirements for the TPOXX stockpile as well as smoothing the annual deliveries, which would be critical to supply chain planning and provide a higher degree of financial predictability.\n\nWith this in mind, I want to highlight that we believe the clinical trial results from the PEP program, especially the immunogenicity trial are an important part of long-term contract conversation.\n\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now begin the Q&A session.\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam McCarter from Edison Group. Please state your question.\n\nAdam McCarter\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question today. I'd like to hear about the progress that SIGA has been making. Just wanted to hear a little bit more about sort of the -- you mentioned already about the international orders. I just wanted to know whether or not you're getting just a little bit more color around the interest regarding the stockpiling.\n\nPhilGomez\n\nSure, Adam. So thanks for the question. We are getting, I would say, a mix of certainly countries that are continuing to follow up on the Mpox outbreak and making sure they have drug on board. And I would say we'll see a mix of both existing and new countries this year based on the conversation. So I would anticipate to build some new conversations. As we've talked before, we've also been reflecting those conversations back to include smallpox because many of the countries had not thought about that. We're encouraged. We certainly have at least one country that looks like it's committing to doing more of a smallpox stockpile than an initial procurement for Mpox, and we continue to have those studies.\n\nSo as Dan said, it continues to evolve, a lot of discussions. It's a slow process as we've seen over time, but encouraged that we still have a growing number of countries we're talking to and starting to be able to also talk about smallpox as well.\n\nAdam McCarter\n\nFantastic. Thank you. And if I could just follow up with another question as well. Just wondering about if you -- just in terms of sort of data comes in our placebo-controlled studies in monkeypox. When can you give any guidance on when we might expect to see some sort of data from those studies coming out in the near term?\n\nPhilGomez\n\nYes, I can add a little bit. I mean, Dennis talked about this that we have a lot of placebo-controlled studies ongoing, but case levels have come down substantially. Although we have seen, for example, in Japan, there's a slowly growing number of cases that are there. So I think there's two parts of that driving the time line. One is what is the case load. If we see an increase as we did last spring in cases. I think the good news is there are placebo-controlled studies throughout the world that will try and catch those, both in U.S., Europe, South America, Asia. So there's a lot of work that's been done to set up those studies and try and catch those. But if we don't see the caseload increase, it's going to be hard to do that.\n\nThe second part is, as Dennis highlighted, which is, I think, very important. The groups, which are predominantly governments, places like NIH in the U.S., Oxford University in the U.K. government in the U.K., WHO has helped support some of the studies in Europe. They're starting to talk amongst the clinical network and also stock to regulators to make sure whatever data set we have, we can try and pool that, use all of that data to be able to go for approvals. We don't have to wait for 1 study to get to critical mass. So there's been conversations that are encouraging, but we'll have to stay tuned and see where that goes.\n\nAdam McCarter\n\nExcellent. Thank you very much. No further questions from me.\n\nOur next question comes from [indiscernible] an Investor. Please state your question.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nHi, guys. My question is, we've been kicking around this PEP program for the last several years. Is there any way you can quantify as to what the size of the potential of this program could be?\n\nPhil Gomez\n\nThanks, [Joaquin]. I appreciate the question. I hope all is well in retirement for you, and I appreciate you calling in. So there's a couple of ways to answer that question, but the one that we very specifically thought about is the implications for the use of TPOXX for PEP in smallpox, which is that you would go from a 14-day treatment to a 28-day treatment.\n\nCurrently, our contract is for a 1.7 million course requirement. And if you wanted to maintain the ability to treat 1.7 million people with the potential for a lot of those being PEP, you would need to double the amount of drug in the stockpile. So certainly, the initial messaging we've had is at the very least, given the requirements that are already on the books, there's an opportunity to potentially double what the U.S. government buys.\n\nI would also add in two kind of other perspectives on that. One is, for those of you that have been following SIGA a very long time, our original contract in 2011 contemplated up to 12 million courses and options, and BARDA cited PEP is one of the reasons they may need more than the 1.7 million. So there has been a long history of evaluating that with even potentially higher numbers.\n\nBut then the other part is the strategic national stockpile has stated repeatedly, including in their multiyear budget, they don't have full funding for all the things they would like to buy. So there'll certainly be a lens of affordability that could evolve over time. So we think the doubling of the stockpile is an important way to think about it immediately and continue to think about the long-term preparedness that we think the U.S. government ultimately should do.\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ralph Weil from R. Weil Investments. Please state your question.\n\nRalph Weil\n\nThank you again for the special dividend and for the confidence you show in purchasing the shares. I have one question. Are you -- besides smallpox and Mpox, are you actively involved at this point in working on any vaccine or countermeasure for any other emerging infectious diseases or other attacks, perhaps, bio-defense attacks?\n\nPhilGomez\n\nYes. So Ralph, thank you very much for the question. As you've heard, TPOXX is our licensed product with sales. That is by far our lead product. We do have a candidate product that's in preclinical that also has the potential to treat orthopox infection. We are doing some work on that, but it's very early on. So I wouldn't say that's a major one. We know the government always want to have two products. And the second product that was licensed had a black box warning on it. So we think it's important to continue to think about second-generation products there.\n\nAnd then we do scan for potential products, countermeasures, things that would be in this space to bring on board. We look at the science. We look at the market potential. And we have not brought anything on board to date, but we continue to look at those assets. We continue to monitor the antibiotic space at BARDA for RFP, we expect will come probably this next fiscal year, and we have a partnership with Cipla to go after that RFP with an antibiotic they have, but that's, again, a little further off and that's a partnership, not an asset that we have. But we do very actively look at the space and look at things that we could bring on board that would help us bring products either to the government or to the commercial market. So, thank you for your question.\n\nI'd like to thank everybody for joining us at this first quarter conference call. We appreciate your time. We appreciate your support and look forward to continue to create value for our shareholders. So thank you again, and have a great day.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",
