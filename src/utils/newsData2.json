            "body": "Based on the OI percentage, 58 stocks, including Mphasis, Indian Energy Exchange, Persistent Systems, Chambal Fertilizers, and Aarti Industries, saw a short build-up.\n\nThe recovery in late trade amid consolidation helped the market close flat with a positive bias on June 6, as the three-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee members started a discussion over interest rate decisions.\n\nThe benchmark indices continued the uptrend for the third consecutive session. The BSE Sensex was up 5.4 points at 62,793, while the Nifty50 rose 5.2 points to 18,599 and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating the tug-of-war between bulls and bears for market direction as the closing was similar to opening levels.\n\n\"Normally, such Doji formations after a reasonable up move or down move calls for reversal. Having formed this pattern amidst a range movement, the predictive value of this pattern could be less,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nHe feels immediate supports like daily 10 and 20-day EMAs (exponential moving average) are intact and the intraday buying has been emerging so far from this support in the short term.\n\nOn the upper side, repeated testing of crucial hurdle around the 18,600-18,700 levels is expected to result in a decisive upside breakout, while immediate support is at 18,500 levels, Shetti said.\n\nWe have seen a continued uptrend in broader markets with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 0.06 percent and 0.54 percent, respectively.\n\nWe have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:\n\nNote: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.\n\nKey support, resistance levels on Nifty\n\nThe Nifty may get support at 18,550, followed by 18,528 and 18,493. If the index advances, then 18,619 will be the key resistance followed by 18,641 and 18,676.\n\nNifty Bank\n\nWe have also seen an upward journey in the Bank Nifty for the third day in a row. The index climbed 63 points to 44,165 amid volatility and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale for yet another session.\n\n\"The Doji candle formation suggests that the overall trend is expected to remain sideways, without a clear direction in the index's movement,\" Rupak De, Senior Technical at LKP Securities said.\n\nHe feels the support level is identified at 44,000 and if the index falls below this level, it might drop towards 43,700. On the other hand, the resistance levels are observed at 44,300 and 44,500 acting as barriers to further upward movement, he said.\n\nAs per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,050, followed by 43,997 and 43,910, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,223, then 44,277 and 44,363.\n\nCall options data\n\nOn the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest (OI) was at 18,600 strike, with 1.01 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty.\n\nThis was followed by 18,800 strike comprising 89.43 lakh contracts and 18,700 strike with more than 84 lakh contracts.\n\nThe meaningful Call writing was seen at 18,800 strike, which added 21.1 lakh contracts, followed by 18,900 strike, which added 15.11 lakh contracts, and 19,000 strike, which added 9.3 lakh contracts.\n\nCall unwinding was at 19,500 strike, which shed 41.33 lakh contracts, followed by 18,500 strike, which shed 17.66 lakh contracts, and 19,300 strike, which shed 5.58 lakh contracts.\n\nPut option data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum open interest was at 18,500 strike, with 1 crore contracts, which is expected to be an important support level in the coming sessions.\n\nIt was followed by the 18,600 strike, comprising 93.86 lakh contracts and the 18,400 strike with 70.35 lakh contracts.\n\nPut writing was seen at 18,400 strike, which added 18.28 lakh contracts, followed by 18,200 strike, which added 17.84 lakh contracts and 18,100 strike, which added 9.43 lakh contracts.\n\nPut unwinding was seen at 18,500 strike, which shed 14.51 lakh contracts, followed by 18,700 strike, which shed 7.4 lakh contracts and 17,600 strike which shed 3.41 lakh contracts.\n\nA high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Larsen & Toubro, Petronet LNG, Cummins India, Coal India and United Breweries among others.\n\nAn increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 45 stocks, including JK Cement, Maruti Suzuki India, ACC, Tata Communications and Syngene International saw long buildups.\n\nA decline in OI and price generally indicate a long unwinding. Based on the OI percentage, 28 stocks, including Birlasoft, Escorts, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, Hindustan Copper and Oracle Financial saw a long unwinding.\n\n58 stocks see a short build-up\n\nAn increase in OI along with a price decrease indicates a build-up of short positions. Based on the OI percentage, 58 stocks, including Mphasis, Indian Energy Exchange, Persistent Systems, Chambal Fertilizers and Aarti Industries saw a short build-up.\n\nA decrease in OI along with a price increase is an indication of short-covering. Based on the OI percentage, 58 stocks were on the short-covering list. These included India Cements, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, AU Small Finance Bank, REC and Titan Company.\n\nGravita India: Promoter Rajat Agrawal has sold 13 lakh equity shares or 1.88 percent shareholding in the lead metal manufacturer via open market transaction at an average price of Rs 586.04 per share, which amounted to Rs 76.18 crore.

            "title": "JB Pharma: Betting big on India - Express Pharma",
            "body": "Pegged as one of India's fastest growing pharma companies, JB Pharma's recently released fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2023 results continue to beat market growth rates.\n\nAs per IQVIA MAT March 2023 data, JB Pharma continued to be the fastest growing company amongst the Top 25 in FY23, outperforming the Indian Pharma Market (IPM), growing at 22 per cent versus 8 per cent, aided by the organic business growing at 21 per cent. India business (domestic sales) of the overall sector grew by 15 per cent for Q4 FY23, whereas JB Pharma's domestic business grew double at 30 per cent. (See BOX: JB Pharma Business highlights: Q4 FY23 and FY23).\n\nWill JB Pharma's dream run continue? And what are the risks of pursuing an acquisition-driven growth strategy? As pharma promoters in the India pharma sector contemplate bringing strategic investors on board, JB Pharma's transition strategy and steady rise up the ranks is being closely observed and could well become a success story worth emulating by its peers in the sector.\n\nNikhil Chopra, CEO and Wholetime Director, JB Pharma commented that this \"market-beating performance\" is \"pivoted around their strategy to make big brands becoming bigger, and significant demand acceleration in the acquired portfolio.\" He pointed out that each of their top seven brands (Rantac, Cilacar, Cilacar-T, Metrogyl, Nicardia, Azmarda and Sporlac) have ascended through the ranks. Further, Sporlac, the acquired business in probiotics and pediatric segment, is the newest entrant to IQVIA's Top 300 brands from their portfolio.\n\nTill 2020, JB Pharma was like many promoter-driven pharma companies. Started in 1976 by the late JB Mody as JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Laboratories (JBCPL), the company made a name for itself with brands like Metrogyl (1977), Nicardia (1980), Rantac (1989), Cilacar (2007). Overseas, the company's Doktor Mom and Rinza brands were able to tap into the Russia and CIS OT market.\n\nFounder JB Mody carefully steered the ship through the choppy seas of evolving regulations, spiralling prices and increasing price control. Cut to July 2020, when the JBCPL founders sold controlling stakes to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and co (KKR).\n\nWith KKR at the helm, and a new management team headed by Chopra, the company jumped nine ranks in two years, from rank #32 in MAT 2021, to #23 in 2023. The company's prescriptions continue to grow at a market-beating pace; with the company ending FY23 ranked #15 in the IPM.\n\nAnalysing JB Pharma's transformation strategy post KKR acquiring majority controlling stakes in the company, Chopra highlights three major initiatives.\n\n1. Transformation of India business by establishing a new go-to-market model, making big brands bigger.\n\nAfter KKR came on board in July 2020, Chopra reveals how they took up a restructuring exercise both internally and externally. Showing its aggressive intent, the new management had initiated a series of measures to transform the entire business.\n\nHe narrates how the management put forth an accelerated growth strategy where they would not only build upon core competencies but also leverage strengths to enter into new therapeutic areas. Backed by over 5,000 employees including a 2,500-strong sales force, Chopra says JB Pharma has put in place a new 'go-to-market' model, where they focus on life-cycle management for big brands and evaluate new growth opportunities to further enhance productivity.\n\nGiving more granular detail, Chopra explains how their focus on making \"big brands ... bigger was substantiated by launching line extensions of existing franchises and focussing on sales force excellence and automation. Furthermore, expansion into tier 4 and rural towns helped India business in increasing the reach and availability for current brands.\"\n\nChopra analyses how one of the pillars of strategy has been acquisition-led growth. JB Pharma completed four major acquisitions (brands from Sanzyme, Azmarda, Razel franchise and paediatric portfolio from Dr Reddy's Laboratories), thus foraying into the fast-growing probiotics, paediatric and the niche of the heart failure segment. These portfolios offer deep geographic and distribution synergies along with prescriber overlap. In six months, Sporlac now is among the top three brands in the probiotic segment, providing significant opportunities to expand through line extensions.\n\nChopra revealed that he emphasised a 'beyond the pill' marketing approach in the Indian pharma industry, which involved organic and inorganic initiatives to enhance patient awareness, education, diagnosis and adherence through various 'phygital' initiatives.\n\nOther areas of expertise include digitalisation of the pharma field force and engagement with doctors, nurturing talent and creating cross-functional collaborations and propagating technology in improving healthcare access and awareness.\n\nHe stresses that for JB Pharma, the domestic formulations business remains a key focus area and it has been consistently growing at better than industry growth rate over the last several years.\n\nHe also refers to another trend in the IPM. While India has historically been a market dominated by acute therapies, the trend has been shifting to a larger contribution from chronic drugs in the consumption base. As per IQVIA IMS data, the share of chronic therapies in the IPM has expanded from 31 per cent to 36 per cent in the period between FY13 and FY21. This is in line with the trend in several global economies that have seen a larger incidence of lifestyle diseases on the back of improved diagnoses and better compliance by patients.\n\nJB Pharma's international business contributes around 50 per cent of the total revenue, comprises three segments: export formulations, API and contract manufacturing. The business grew by 16 per cent to Rs 382 crores in Q4 FY23 versus Rs 330 crores in Q4 FY22. The international formulations business was at Rs 255 crores in Q4 Fy23 versus Rs 218 crores in Q4 FY22 recording growth of 17 per cent.\n\nJB Pharma operates distinct operating models across multiple international businesses with a direct presence in Russia and South Africa as well as distributor relationships in the US and a large number of markets across Asia, Africa and Latin America. According to Chopra, JB Pharma has a leading global position in the contract manufacturing market driven by marquee client relationships.\n\n3. Development beyond financial metrics to a new cultural identity\n\nJB Pharma also recently marked one year of a new corporate identity as JB, centred on being \"simple, reliable and agile\" while building on the strong foundation of \"integrity, trust and reliability\" nurtured over the past 45 odd years.\n\nExplaining the vision behind the new identity, Chopra said, \"The company offerings and capabilities are becoming more diverse to cater to the evolving needs of customers, manufacturing processes are becoming more robust, and lean, and our vision of looking at the healthcare industry is becoming more progressive globally.\n\nWe are adapting ourselves to become more responsive to the needs of the healthcare world. In sync with the evolving healthcare industry and the changing need of customers, JB has re-visioned the cause of spreading good health in India. JB aims to support healthcare providers and enrich patients' lives in innovative new ways while remaining committed to its core values of integrity, trust and reliability built over 45 years.\"\n\nThis was inculcated in terms of initiatives within the organisation that made employees and departments agile and cultivated a cross-collaborative culture. As CEO, Chopra reportedly played an active role in developing this and led leadership culture-building exercises such as OneJBWay (a leadership transformational programme). Furthermore, the same OneJBWay culture is cascaded to the second in line of leaders (N-2) through a forward-looking leadership training and excellence programme called LEAP.\n\n4. Publishing inaugural sustainability (ESG) report\n\nChopra explains how the ESG report was prepared following the international reporting standards framework, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as its Core Standard, and linkages with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAs per Chopra, from FY 2020 to FY 2022, the organisation has reduced energy consumption by 9.2 per cent and augmented green energy through solar power. Additionally, its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have reduced by 14.6 per cent and 10.7 per cent during the same period. During the reporting period, waste sent for co-processing stood at 757.65 MT. All sites are Zero Liquid Discharge.\n\nLooking ahead, Chopra is emphatic that \"our biggest bet is India as 50 per cent of our revenue comes from here. We will continue to leverage opportunities that lead us to organic growth and diversify into newer categories that can be in generic formulations, wellness etc. We will also be looking for acquisition opportunities, which are a strategic fit and assure returns within the payback period. The other strategy is to grow our big brands such as Cilacar, Cilacar-T, Rantac, Metrogyl, Nicardia and Azmarda.\"\n\nSpelling out the goals for the next few years, Chopra says that they plan on accelerating towards their 50th year in 2025. \"In the next three years, we want to increase our market share by being among the top 20 companies in the IPM market. Under the new strategy, our major focus is to strengthen our core therapy segments i.e., hypertension, respiratory, gastroenterology, nephrology, cardiology, dentistry, and paediatrics.\n\nIf FY21 was about realigning the structure and portfolio to ensure sustainable growth and focussing strongly on the lifecycle management of their flagship brands, the next priority is to scale up R&D and business development initiatives towards building a progressive portfolio for the US, Russia, South Africa, and API. Chopra says that they will focus on consolidating their business areas through a deeper presence in existing geographies and this will be aided by multiple new launches over the next two to three years.\n\nWith four brand acquisitions in 15 months and close to 1500+ appointments, across businesses and geographies in the last year, JB Pharma's new identity is evidently an attempt to ensure common brand values across a rapidly expanding workforce.\n\nChopra says that each brand acquisition came with a sales force from different companies that was relevant to their existing salesforce team and gave geographical synergies. This added almost 500-600 people across divisions of heart failure, hypertension, wellness, respiratory etc.\n\nAnd Chopra reveals that there could be more acquisitions, as the company will continue to evaluate (further brand acquisition) opportunities and see if there are assets available within the space of paediatrics, cardiology, metabolics, respiratory, and anti-infectives.\n\nIt will be interesting to observe how JB Pharma is able to assimilate the 'acquired' sales force into a cohesive entity. Talent retention will be a key component, given the cutthroat competition in the IPM. According to Chopra, the company's continuous focus/endeavours on talent retention led to 200+ promotions in FY23. Most pharma companies struggle to increase productivity per sales professional, leading to high attrition rates.\n\nChopra reiterates, \"Our current philosophy has a strong foundation of the legacy brand on which the new identity has been built and carried forward. This is highlighted best in three aspects - our people, our results and our products. We are the fastest growing company with fast-tracked growth for careers as well. This is supplemented by strong learning and development programmes across levels and locations. Last but not the least, a healthy work-life balance is critical to increased productivity which is catered to by our wellness initiatives. We are also in the process of introducing a competency matrix which would aid in talent retention.\"",

            "body": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten top rated stocks billionaires are loading up on. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Top-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\n\nThe U.S. economy has undergone several shocks over the past couple of years. This turmoil started after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019 which led to lockdowns and a broader downturn in economic activity in 2020. The slowdown led to investors fleeing away from the stock market due to the potential impact of lockdowns and stay at home orders on general productivity. They, however, returned back in droves after it became clear that the technology sector would be the biggest beneficiary of the chaos.\n\nThen, as the world wearily looked towards normalcy in 2022, the after effects of expansionary fiscal policy during the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine dealt a massive inflationary blow to the economy. This blow led the Federal Reserve - which had initially mistaken the inflation as transitory - to aggressively increase interest rates in an attempt to curtail economic activity and reign in the beast of inflation.\n\nYet, as if all this wasn't enough, 2023 started off with another crisis a.k.a. the debt ceiling. The specter (and spectacle?) of a default by the largest economy in the world almost scared the daylights out of both government officials and investors. Thankfully though, this crisis is over as legislation in Capitol Hill to raise the debt ceiling cleared Senate and Congress in June 2023.\n\nWith the debt ceiling out of the way, the only worry that remains is that of a potential recession. The Federal Reserve is quite optimistic that it can avoid this outcome. However, its fight just took a complicated turn in June when the labor data for May 2023 came in. This data shows that in May, 339,000 new jobs were added to the economy, smashing Wall Street estimates of 195,000 out of the park. Yet, at the same time, the unemployment percentage of 3.7% surpassed estimates of 3.5% - making sure that the latest report remained stuck smack in the middle when it comes to looking in the crystal ball to see what the Fed might do in its upcoming meeting later this month.\n\nAmidst this chaos, some economists pointed to the upcoming data for the consumer price index (CPI) figures due in the second week of June, and others shared that don't be fooled to believe that a recession is on its way. This voice belongs to the chief economist of the financial research firm FWDBONDS LLC who shared with Bloomberg:\n\nEven then, as most folks struggle with inflation, hedge funds are busy making money. And as they say, to make money, you have to spend money. And despite the turmoil in the financial market, the funds are out with the big bucks. Just how big? Well, some are eager to guarantee top stock investing talent a stunning $120 million in payouts\n\nSo it would make sense to follow what the professionals are doing and see how they are placing their bets.

            "body": "The Nifty is trading at a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 18.6x, below its long-period average (LPA) of 20x, while the P/B ratio, at 2.9x, is at an 8% premium to its historical average.\n\nThe 12-month trailing P/E for the Nifty, at 22.2x, is near to its LPA of 21.8x and at 3.3x, the 12-month trailing P/B ratio for the Nifty is above its historical average of 3x, the report highlighted.\n\nThe report comes when the benchmark Nifty is trading just around 300 points below its life-time high of 18,887.60. The index has gained 4.8% in the last three months led by persistent foreign capital inflows, better than estimated corporate earnings for the March quarter and improving domestic macroeconomic scenario.\n\nInflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in the Indian equities remained robust as they purchased equities worth ₹41,206.76 crore in the month of May.\n\nAlso Read: FPI flows to drive markets as US seen at interest rate peak\n\nOver the last twelve months, the MSCI India index was up 7% and has outperformed the MSCI EM index that was down 11%. Over the last 10 years, it has outperformed the MSCI EM index by 173%, the Motilal Oswal report said.\n\nIn P/E terms, the MSCI India index is trading at a 100% premium to the MSCI EM index, above its historical average of 70%, it noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Nifty companies trading at a significant premium to their historical average include Divi's Laboratories(+51%), Grasim Industries (+47%), Reliance Industries (+45%), Nestle (+24%), and Tech Mahindra (+23%).\n\nWhereas, companies trading at a significant discount to their historical average include ONGC (-56%), Tata Steel (-52%), Coal India (-33%), Apollo Hospital (-29%), and Dr Reddy's Laboratories (-28%).\n\nCatch Live Market Updates here\n\nThe Auto sector is trading at a P/E of 21.1x, below its 10-year historical average of 26.5x, while on a P/B basis, it is trading at a 13% premium to its 10-year average of 3.3x. \"We believe 2W volume should continue to see sequential growth, led by a recovery in rural demand and a pickup in exports,\" Motilal Oswal said.\n\nThe consumer sector's P/E ratio, at 42.3x, represents a 6% premium to its 10-year average of 39.7x. On a P/B basis, it is trading at 11.4x, a premium of 12% against its historical average of 10.2x.\n\n\"Management commentary suggests that demand is recovering in rural markets. Unseasonal rainfall has affected beverages demand in some parts of the country. Companies have started to pass on the benefits of lower commodity costs to consumers,\" the brokerage added.\n\nThe PSU Banks sector is trading at a P/B ratio of 1.0x, a 20% premium to its historical average of 0.8x. The Private Banks sector is trading at a P/B ratio of 2.5x, its 10-year average. ROE is at a 10-year high of 16% for private banks.\n\n\"Earnings for PSU Banks remained healthy, led by a broad-based improvement in key parameters, such as margin, operating profitability, and credit cost. Improving profitability and a reduction in risk-weight intensity have further boosted capital ratios for PSU banks,\" it added.\n\nWith the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) keeping policy rates unchanged, the brokerage house believes systemic interest rates have likely peaked. However, garnering deposits will be important. The rise in deposit costs (due to lag in re-pricing), along with a pause in rate hikes may keep margin under pressure in FY24, it said.",

            "body": "The buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks. The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions. \"Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said. He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action. \"The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,\" Shetti said. The broader markets continued the uptrend for more than a couple of weeks now, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index up 0.14 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.36 percent. We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades: Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month. Key support, resistance levels on Nifty The Nifty may get support at 18,584, followed by 18,570 and 18,548. If the index advances, 18,628 will be the key resistance followed by 18,641 and 18,663. Nifty Bank The Bank Nifty continued its uptrend for the second consecutive session and rose 164 points to 44,102, forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale making higher high and higher low formation, as the market participants were cautious ahead of the outcome of a three-day policy meeting by the RBI. \"The Bank Nifty index is expected to continue to trade within the range of 43,700-44,300. This suggests that the index is likely to move sideways, lacking a clear trend,\" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical &amp; Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said. However, he says that a break on either side of this range can lead to a directional move, potentially indicating a shift in the market sentiment and momentum. As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,074, followed by 44,029 and 43,955, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,221, then 44,266, and 44,339.

            "body": "Based on the OI percentage, 53 stocks including Oracle Financial, India Cements, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Lupin and Deepak Nitrite saw long buildups.\n\nThe buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.\n\nThe BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.\n\n\"Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nHe says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.\n\n\"The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,\" Shetti said.\n\nThe broader markets continued the uptrend for more than a couple of weeks now, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index up 0.14 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.36 percent.\n\nWe have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:\n\nNote: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.\n\nKey support, resistance levels on Nifty\n\nThe Nifty may get support at 18,584, followed by 18,570 and 18,548. If the index advances, 18,628 will be the key resistance followed by 18,641 and 18,663.\n\nNifty Bank\n\nThe Bank Nifty continued its uptrend for the second consecutive session and rose 164 points to 44,102, forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale making higher high and higher low formation, as the market participants were cautious ahead of the outcome of a three-day policy meeting by the RBI.\n\n\"The Bank Nifty index is expected to continue to trade within the range of 43,700-44,300. This suggests that the index is likely to move sideways, lacking a clear trend,\" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.\n\nHowever, he says that a break on either side of this range can lead to a directional move, potentially indicating a shift in the market sentiment and momentum.\n\nAs per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,074, followed by 44,029 and 43,955, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,221, then 44,266, and 44,339.\n\nOn the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest (OI) was at 18,600 strike, with 1.03 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty.\n\nThis was followed by 18,700 strike comprising 82.41 lakh contracts and 18,500 strike with more than 68.68 lakh contracts.\n\nThe meaningful Call writing was seen at 18,700 strike, which added 19.89 lakh contracts, followed by 18,900 strike, which added 12.77 lakh contracts, and 19,000 strike, which added 10.02 lakh contracts.\n\nCall unwinding was at 18,500 strike, which shed 8.45 lakh contracts, followed by 18,400 strike, which shed 1.33 lakh contracts, and 18,300 strike, which shed 1.07 lakh contracts.\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum open interest was at 18,500 strike, with 1.15 crore contracts, which is expected to be an important support level in the coming sessions.\n\nIt was followed by the 18,600 strike, comprising 91.99 lakh contracts, and the 18,000 strike with 55.52 lakh contracts.\n\nPut writing was seen at 18,600 strike, which added 34 lakh contracts, followed by 18,700 strike, which added 13.55 lakh contracts, and 18,500 strike, which added 13.1 lakh contracts.\n\nPut unwinding was seen at 17,800 strike, which shed 5.78 lakh contracts, followed by 18,100 strike, which shed 2.77 lakh contracts, and 17,900 strike which shed 1.78 lakh contracts.\n\nA high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Power Grid Corporation of India, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and JK Cement, among others.\n\n53 stocks see a long build-up\n\nAn increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 53 stocks, including Oracle Financial, India Cements, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Lupin and Deepak Nitrite saw long buildups.\n\nA decline in OI and price generally indicate a long unwinding. Based on the OI percentage, 42 stocks, including Hero MotoCorp, Info Edge India, IndiaMART InterMESH, Nestle India, and AU Small Finance Bank, saw a long unwinding.\n\nAn increase in OI along with a price decrease indicates a build-up of short positions. Based on the OI percentage, 40 stocks, including Manappuram Finance, L&T Finance Holdings, Hindalco Industries, Mphasis and Max Financial Services, saw a short build-up.\n\n50 stocks see short-covering\n\nA decrease in OI along with a price increase is an indication of short-covering. Based on the OI percentage, 50 stocks were on the short-covering list. These included Ipca Laboratories, Dixon Technologies, Ashok Leyland, Bosch, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company.\n\nCeinsys Tech: Zodius Technology Fund sold another 1.42 lakh shares in the software solutions provider via open market transaction at an average price of Rs 187.15 per share.

            "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Value Stocks to Buy in June 2023",
            "body": "With the market facing myriad pressure points - predominantly stubbornly high inflation along with general anxieties about an incoming recession - the bright side is that investors have options regarding the best undervalued value stocks for June. Still, you don't want to just chase deflated entities just because they're down.\n\nInstead, the main focus for the top bargain stocks for June centers on discovering solid businesses that, for whatever reason, don't get the respect they deserve. Perhaps they fell under hard times through no fault of their own. Or in other cases simply lack the excitement that the flavors of the week provide.\n\nIn fairness, sometimes entities can be discounted for good reason. However, with thousands of securities listed in various exchanges, it's practically inevitable that certain good companies will be overlooked. Naturally, this dynamic offers an excellent entry point for astute investors. And on that note, below are the best value stocks to buy in June.\n\nFounded in 1984, India-based Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE:RDY) is a multinational pharmaceutical company. According to its public profile, Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, and 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology. Since the start of the year, RDY gained nearly 8%.\n\nSlipping a bit below the performance of the U.S. benchmark S&P 500, RDY ranks among the best undervalued value stocks for June on a technical (price chart) basis. From a financial perspective, Dr. Reddy's delivers strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 12%, above 68% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 33.1%, better than 79.39% of rivals.\n\nStill, RDY trades at a trailing multiple of 16.62. As a discount to earnings, the pharma ranks better than 64.88% of the competition. It also features a price-earnings-growth ratio of 0.88 times, below the sector median of 1.87 times. Notably, Wall Street analysts rate RDY as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $67, implying 20% upside potential.\n\nBased in Brazil, Ternium (NYSE:TX) is Latin America's leading flat steel producer, with operating facilities in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the southern U.S., and Central America. Per its public profile, Ternium offers a broad range of high value-added steel products for customers active in the automotive, home appliances, HVAC, construction, capital goods, container, food, and energy industries through its various facilities and distribution networks.\n\nGaining almost 30% since the January opener, TX might not seem like one of the best undervalued value stocks for June. However, the market prices TX at a trailing multiple of 5.56, ranking better than 73.47% of the competition in terms of earnings discount. As well, TX trades at 0.68 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median stat is 0.99 times.\n\nOperationally, Ternium makes a compelling case for high return undervalued stocks because of its three-year revenue growth rate of 17.2%. This stat comes in above 73.58% of companies listed in the steel industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period impresses at 21.5%. Lastly, analysts peg TX as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $50.70, implying nearly 31% upside potential.\n\nArguably the most compelling name among the best undervalued value stocks for June, InMode (NASDAQ:INMD) is a leading global provider of innovative medical technologies. Per its corporate profile, InMode develops, manufactures, and markets devices harnessing novel radio frequency technology. Further, the medical specialist strives to enable new emerging surgical procedures as well as improve existing treatments.\n\nTo be fair, it's one of the riskiest examples of undervalued stocks with growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, INMD slipped nearly 9%. At the same time, the company delivers strong operational stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 37.3%, ranked better than 89.9% of its peers. As well, its EBITDA growth rate over the same period impresses at 43.5%.\n\nNevertheless, the market prices INMD at a forward multiple of 12.28. As a discount to projected earnings, InMode ranks better than 94.9% of the competition. Combined with a cash-rich balance sheet, INMD makes for one of the best value stocks to buy in June. On a final note, analysts peg INMD as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $47, implying 46% upside potential.",

            "title": "Portfolio: 3 BIGGEST Pharma Cos. to Keep a Tab on!",
            "body": "The pharma sector is considered to be a defensive one and investors keep some of the strong companies from this sector in their portfolios for the diversification purpose. This is not an action-packed sector but delivers steady growth over the long haul.\n\nIn case you are looking for some blue-chip pharma stocks, here are the 3 biggest pharma companies, as per their revenues in FY23.\n\nSun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited\n\nSun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NS: SUN ) is the biggest pharma company in India, having a market capitalization of INR 2,36,982.31 crores and trading at a P/E ratio of 27.81. It also clocked a record-high revenue of INR 44,520.2 crores in FY23, which was the highest revenue by any listed-pharma company in the country.\n\nThe net income was reported at INR 8,521.48 crores, translating into a profit margin of 19.14%, the highest margin since FY17. FIIs have consistently been increasing their stake, notching it up from 13% in December 2021 to 16.89% in March 2023. The stock has been an outperformer in the last 12 months, delivering a return of 16.2%, compared to Nifty Pharma's return of 3.9%.\n\nDr Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd (NS: REDY ) is not the second-largest pharma co. in terms of market cap, but it is so when FY23 revenue is concerned. This INR 75,635.38 crores big drug manufacturer clocked a revenue of INR 25,762.2 crores, a 16.5% YoY jump, while net profit more than doubled to INR 4,507.3 crores.\n\nThis translated into a profit margin of 17.5%, the highest since FY15, at least. FIIs are holding a massive stake of 38.55% which could be due to its valuation, as the current P/E ratio is just 16.78, compared to the sector's average of 33.94.\n\nAurobindo Pharma Limited\n\nAurobindo Pharma Ltd. (NS: ARBN ) is engaged in producing oral and injectable generic formulations and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), having a market capitalization of INR 38,595 crores. It clocked a revenue of INR 25,145.97 crores which was the third-highest revenue in this sector in FY23.\n\nHowever, the company's profit margins of 7.67% were subdued and lowest in the last few years. Despite this, the stock was able to attract some FIIs' interest this quarter, as they ramped up their stake from 22.32% in December 2022 to 23.03% in March 2023. It has also been a good performer in the last 12 months, delivering a sector-beating return of 26.7%.",

            "title": "Trade setup for Monday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell",
            "body": "The market recouped the previous day's losses and snapped a two-day losing streak on June 2, on broad-based buying, with the Sensex closing 119 points higher at 62,547 and the Nifty50 ending at 18,534, up 46 points. The Nifty, which traded within the previous day's range, formed a small bodied bearish candlestick with minor upper and long lower shadows on the daily charts. The pattern indicates formation of Inside Bar candle with overlapping candles. \"The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms continued as per daily timeframe chart and the present consolidation could be in line with the higher bottom formation of the pattern. The higher bottom reversal pattern has not been confirmed yet,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said. Considering the recent consolidation and the subsequent negation of such bearish patterns, one can expect a bounce in the market in the coming week, he said. For Nifty, immediate support is at 18,400-18,300 and the upside hurdle is at 18,650-18,850, Shetti said. The broader market outperformed the benchmark. Nifty midcap 100 and smallcap 100 indices gained half a percent each. We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades: Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month. Key support, resistance levels on Nifty The Nifty may get support at 18,492 followed by 18,470 and 18,433. If the index advances, 18,565 will be the key resistance followed by 18,588 and 18,624. Nifty Bank The Bank Nifty also traded in line with benchmarks, rising 148 points to 43,938 on June 2 and formed a small bearish candlestick with upper and lower shadows, which resembled the Inside Bar pattern on the daily scale, indicating rangebound trade. It continued forming llower highs for the third straight day. \"At this juncture, the Bank Nifty has rising trendline support at 43,700. Going ahead, a close below 43,700 might spoil the party for the bulls and we might witness profit booking in the markets,\" Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research, AnandRathi, said. On the upside, 44,500 would be an initial resistance on way to the 45,000 milestone. As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 43,841 followed by 43,776 and 43,670. Resistance will be at 44,052 then 44,117, and 44,223.

            "body": "Hyderabad : The 9th edition of PharmaLytica, a premier pharmaceutical exhibition, commenced with an unwavering commitment to adapt to the changing healthcare landscape, and meet dynamic patient and business requirements. Organised by Informa Markets in India, the three-day event is taking place at HITEX, Hyderabad, hosting over 150 exhibitors. Allied to South Asia's largest Pharma event, the CPhI & P-MEC India show, PharmaLytica is expected to witness over 6000 domestic and international visitors from 16 countries and 21 Indian states, and approximately 250 delegates over the duration of the expo.\n\nThis event serves as a testament to India's vision of becoming the pharmacy of the world, providing a platform that contributes significantly to achieving this ambitious objective. The future of pharma will leverage Robotics and Digitalization to a significantly high degree. These include the use of automated systems, data analytics, and cloud-based architecture, which attendees can witness at PharmaLytica 2023.\n\nThe Event had participation from key stakeholders from the Pharmaceutical Industry including Chief Guest Shri Jayesh Ranjan, IAS, Principal Secretary, Industries & Commerce Dept, Government of Telangana; R.K. Agrawal, National President, Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India (BDMAI); Harish Jain, President, Karnataka Drugs & Pharmaceutical Manufactures (KDPMA); Avinash Kumar Talwar, Vice President, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Shankar Gupta, Chief Sales Officer, ACG; Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India and Rahul Deshpande, Senior Group Director, Informa Markets in India.\n\nHighlighting the importance of technology, Shri Jayesh Ranjan, IAS, Principal Secretary, Industries & Commerce Dept, Government of Telangana said, \"The pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical devices industry in Telangana has experienced remarkable growth, surpassing initial expectations. Initially projected to reach $100 billion in ten years, the industry has already reached a substantial size of $80 billion, prompting a revision of the target to $250 billion. This buoyancy reflects the industry's potential and highlights the need for the sector to showcase advanced and sophisticated technologies, moving beyond bulk manufacturing. The pharmaceutical industry plays a pivotal role as part of the government's \"Atmanirbhar\" strategy, necessitating introspection and revaluation to propel further growth. Additionally, the increasing importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, driven primarily by European buyers, is shaping the future trajectory of the pharmaceutical sector. The industry must prioritize the integration of cutting-edge knowledge and technology into their processes, and participants in this exhibition will greatly benefit from the extensive showcase of advanced technology, equipment, and machinery.\"\n\nR.K. Agrawal, National President, BDMAI said, \"The pharmaceutical industry is moving towards transparency and visibility, where maintain comprehensive and digitalized records becomes imperative to showcase processes, testing and manufacturing to regulatory authorities during audits. Further, automation and technological advancements contribute to increased efficiency and reduced reliance on manual labor. Despite a highly regulated industry, with approximately 30 Government Departments monitoring operations, the Pharma sector has embraced stringent pollution norms, resulting in improved conditions within pharmaceutical plants. Furthermore, the Indian Government's supportive policies such as streamlining regulatory processes, promoting research and development, and encouraging investments create a conducive environment for industry growth. India is already being recognized as the Pharmacy of the world, and the country is a net exporter of drugs to over 195 countries, which is widely accepted. The sector was growing at a rate of 5% during the Pandemic, and now expected to grow at a rate of 8 to 10%. The Indian drug industry can provide good quality drugs at an affordable price thereby changing the landscape of affordability by providing anti-viral drugs at 1/10th of price to countries like Africa. Bulk Drugs constitute 25% ($15 Billion) of the Indian Pharma industry. Also, once the new Pharma City comes up in Telangana, investment of more than INR. 15000-20000 crores are easily possible by the local API manufacturers, which will further attract more FDI.\"\n\nFocused on achieving the aspirational growth, Harish Jain, President, Karnataka Drugs and Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (KDPMA), said, \"India's aspirations in the pharmaceutical industry go beyond its current ranking of 14th in value. The aim is to break into the top five and elevate its position in the value chain. While India is poised for a substantial 8 to 10% volume growth, the focus lies on achieving aspirational growth through innovation rather than traditional generics. This entails embracing new drug delivery systems to propel the industry forward. Research and development, along with awareness of cutting-edge equipment and testing methods, play a crucial role in realizing this vision. Events like PharmaLytica serve to enhance awareness about the latest advancements in equipment, testing methods, and machinery, enabling us to stay informed about emerging technologies.\"\n\nMr. Avinash Kumar Talwar, Vice President, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories said, \"Hyderabad is the biggest market for pharmaceuticals, and the city is known as the Pharma hub of India. The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is valued at around $50 Billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% by 2030. The pharmaceutical market in India is expected to reach $65 Billion by 2024, and $130 Billion by 2030. As the growth of Pharma market is coming from complex molecules, it will force them to invest and build future state-of-the art labs. The demand for sophisticated equipments and instruments to aid in the process of drug discovery, development, analysis and modelling of the compounds will continue to grow at the same pace. We should be proud that in total there are 214 US FDA approved facilities in Hyderabad which is impressive and that is another reason why Hyderabad is known as the Pharma hub of India. There are many small laboratories in Hyderabad and other South Indian cities like Chennai and Bengaluru who probably cannot visit the overseas equipment manufacturers and other such great expos. Hence, events like PharmaLytica will help provide them with the opportunity to participate and modernize their labs with technologies that will be displayed during the exhibition. Buyers and sellers can exchange their views and explore business opportunities through this event. Pharma packaging involves all the operations, from productions to drug distribution channels to the end customer. Factors such as rising number of pharmaceutical industries in an emerging economy, and rising demand for drug deliver devices, packaging are the major drivers for the pharma packaging market. The current challenge for the packaging industry is to have sustainable packaging at the optimum price along with new industry trends like ESG, and I am sure events like this would help the industry align better and take it to new heights.\"\n\nShankar Gupta, Chief Sales Officer, ACG said, \"We are proud of India's pharmaceutical industry, which has gained immense recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our country has earned global fame by supplying medicines, including COVID vaccines, not only to our own citizens but also to people worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry in India is experiencing remarkable growth, being the third largest producer by volume and 14th largest by value. However, we strive to further expand our presence and increase the value of our products. Going global is crucial for this endeavor. Events like the one organized by Informa Markets are instrumental in promoting the Indian pharmaceutical industry on an international scale.

            "body": "Contract development and manufacturing organisations undergo several rounds of inspections before they are engaged by client companies to make key drug ingredients.\n\nOver the past year, the US Food and Drug Administration has slapped restrictions on the manufacturing facilities of some Indian generic drug companies that sell medicines in the US for failing to meet good manufacturing practices.\n\nIn almost stark contrast, contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMO), which make key drug ingredients for pharmaceutical client companies after carrying out innovation and development work, hardly fail to meet the FDA's rigorous manufacturing standards.\n\nConsequently, generic drug companies lose revenue because the launch of their new products is delayed until the curbs on their manufacturing facilities are lifted by the US regulator.\n\nIn India, examples of CDMOs include Laurus Labs and Suven Pharmaceuticals. Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries are among the main generic drug manufacturers.\n\nSun Pharma said on April 23 it will temporarily halt production at its Mohali manufacturing unit to implement corrective measures, as guided by the FDA, before it can release further product batches into the US.\n\nAlso Read: Is dual drug filing the right tactic for pharma companies now?\n\nA pharma analyst for a domestic brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that CDMOs undergo several rounds of inspections by their clients before they go ahead with checks from the FDA.\n\nAfter going through so many inspections by their clients, the manufacturing units become well-equipped to clear the FDA's checks, the analyst said.\n\nAlso Read: Delayed drug launches to hurt Cipla's earnings in FY24\n\n\"Drawing a comparison over the inspection results of CDMOs and US generic players is like comparing the results of a student who has taken several mock tests before giving an exam while the other has landed straight to writing the paper,\" the analyst said.\n\nVineet Gala, the founder of Xylem Investment Managers who tracks the pharma sector, said client inspections help but he majorly attributed the relatively easier ride for CDMOs to the lower scrutiny they face because the production process for each drug is different.\n\n\"CDMO players supplying intermediates/APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) generally face lower scrutiny from the US FDA versus what a typical generic formulations player would,\" Gala said. \"As for players doing formulations in CDMO, many have their plants in the US or the European Union, where standards of compliance are higher even for their employees, giving them an edge over generic players.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The reshuffling exercise is scheduled for May 31. As part of the reshuffling exercise, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Indus Towers will be removed from the MSCI Global Standard Index, while Max Healthcare Institute, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Sona BLW Precision Forgings will be included, as mentioned in the Nuvama report. The removal of Adani companies from the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to lead to outflows of $189 million for Adani Transmission and $167 million for Adani Total Gas. The Nuvama report explains that if Adani Total Gas or Adani Transmission trades at the lower price limit for a cumulative duration of at least 5 minutes on the given day, MSCI will delete these securities at the lowest system price as of the close of May 31, 2023. Otherwise, MSCI will use the official closing prices, following the MSCI Index Calculation methodology. According to Nuvama, the inclusion of Max Healthcare in the MSCI Global Standard Index is projected to result in inflows of $312 million and the addition of 47 million shares. Max Healthcare will carry a weight of 0.52 in the index. Additionally, the inclusion of HAL and Sona BLW is expected to bring inflows of $196 million and $171 million, respectively, with HAL carrying a weight of 0.33 and Sona BLW having a weight of 0.29 in the index. In terms of weight adjustments, 16 stocks are expected to see an increase, while 21 stocks will experience a reduction within the MSCI Global Standard Index. Several other stocks are predicted to have increased weights in the MSCI Global Standard Index. These include Maruti Suzuki India, Zomato, Interglobe Aviation, Samvardhana Motherson International, Cipla, Yes Bank, Bandhan Bank, and NTPC, among others. The weights of Reliance Industries, Infosys, ICICI Bank, JSW Steel, Axis Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Tech Mahindra, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Bharti Airtel are expected to decrease within the MSCI Global Standard Index.",

            "body": "The domestic benchmark indices -- the S&P BSE Sensex and the National Stock Exchange Nifty50 -- had lost close to 1.5 per cent in three days recently before gaining slightly.\n\nIllustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com\n\nNotwithstanding weakness and volatility, the Nifty50 has managed to hold on to the 18,000 mark, while the Sensex has managed to stay above the 61,000 level.\n\nThe performance of the stocks that comprise these front-line indices remains polarised.\n\nThe 20 stocks that comprise the Nifty50 index appear weak, according to their technical chart patterns.\n\nSixteen of these stocks, which include Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, and Cipla, have breached their respective 200-day moving averages (DMA) on the downside.\n\nFor long-term investors, the simple 200-DMA provides a broad outlook on the market or stock trend. Investors and traders prefer stocks holding above their respective 200-DMA as they tend to perform better in a trending market.\n\nRisk management, hence, becomes comparatively easier.\n\nAlternatively, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Larsen & Toubro, Titan Company, and Grasim Industries appear weak as their relative strength indicator (RSI) has slipped below 50.\n\nThe RSI typically oscillates between zero and 100.\n\nA stock or index is considered overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.\n\nThe contribution from the information technology sector to the markets recently has been nothing to write home about.\n\nInfosys, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services have been rangebound with a negative bias.\n\nShares of Adani Group stocks, such as Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, too, remain volatile and will continue to be so until they move past their key resistance levels.\n\nAnalysts believe the market is likely to remain choppy in the near term, and bears may have the upper hand. The 6 per cent rally in the Nifty from March lows, observes V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, has been used as a profit-booking opportunity by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and traders.\n\nThis trend, he believes, is evident from the 'buy the rumour, sell the news' in major stocks like State Bank of India (SBI) and ITC in spite of good 2022-23 (FY23) January-March quarter (fourth quarter, or Q4) results.\n\n\"The Nifty is finding it difficult to break the 18,100-18,400 range despite favourable global cues and good Q4FY23 results.\n\n\"The US 10-year bond yield has risen to 3.64, and the rupee has weakened to 82.65 to the dollar.\n\n\"This currency movement is not supportive of the equity market. Foreign institutional investor buying is being neutralised by DII selling.\n\n\"The 'sell on rally' strategy of bears has worked well this week.\n\n\"The near-term outlook remains cloudy,\" says Vijayakumar.\n\nThe Nifty has until now found some support from select fast-moving consumer goods stocks such as ITC, Britannia Industries, and Nestlé India in the past few weeks.\n\nThese counters have formed 'higher highs and higher lows' in line with their technical chart pattern and are still in bullish mode from a medium-to-long-term perspective.\n\nAmong banking majors, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and SBI appear on track to hit new all-time highs in the weeks ahead, the charts indicate.\n\nTechnical analysts suggest that the markets could find some support at lower levels and that the current weakness will eventually get bought into.\n\n\"If global markets support us, we may see this decline getting bought into, and this time there may be a genuine attempt to retest the higher levels of 18,240-18,300 on the Nifty.\n\n\"On the flip side, 18,100 followed by 18,050 can be considered a strong support zone for the index,\" says Sameet Chavan, head-research, technicals, and derivatives, Angel One.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is meant for information purposes only.

            "title": "Nifty Pharma sees muted performance in 2023; can the stocks change course going ahead?",
            "body": "While most sectoral indices rose with healthy gains, the Nifty Pharma index fell almost by a per cent in the early trade on Monday (May 29), dragged by losses in shares of select heavyweights, including Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma and Divi's Laboratories.\n\nThe pharma sector appears to have lost its mojo after a dream run during the Covid-19 pandemic due to elevated raw material prices, regulatory concerns and price erosion in the generics business in key US markets.\n\nHowever, many analysts now believe that one should look at pharma stocks for the medium to long term as the growth prospects of Indian pharma companies have improved while the valuations of their shares have come down due to the correction.\n\n\"One should look at pharma stocks with a medium-long term horizon as valuations are attractive, earnings are expected to improve and multiples may expand gradually,\" said Cyndrella Carvalho, a pharma research analyst at JM Financial Institutional Securities.\n\n\"The medium-term outlook for the pharma sector is positive. We expect a gradual US recovery as the pace of ANDA approvals accelerates and price erosion stabilises. US business growth will primarily come from complex generics and innovation; we believe those companies with strong R&D capabilities and low compliance risk can participate in this growth,\" said the analyst.\n\nCarvalho expects the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) to grow in double digits led by 6-7 per cent price growth, 2-3 per cent new launches and 2-4 per cent volume growth in FY24.\n\n\"India markets will see field force expansion, participation in patent expiries and increased mergers and acquisitions. We expect emerging markets and the rest of the world markets to report double-digit growth as supply chain challenges and adverse forex impact eases,\" said Carvalho.\n\nCarvalho observed that the March quarter earnings of the pharma sector players have been mixed primarily due to concerns around margins and lacklustre US base business growth.\n\n\"US business surprised on the upside primarily due to higher gRevlimid contribution. While other business revenues were broadly in line, EBITDA margins (ex-Revlimid) were weak due to subdued US base business growth and NLEM's impact on domestic business,\" Carvalho pointed out.\n\n\"Gross margins improved marginally as high-cost inventory got exhausted and we expect this trend to continue going forward. EM/ ROW markets performed well during the quarter. Notably, most companies under our coverage have strengthened their balance sheet and are scouting for inorganic opportunities,' Carvalho said.\n\nGirish Sodani, Head of Equity Market at Swastika Investmart underscored that the pharmaceutical market in India had revenues dip for the second consecutive month in March 2022 after expanding for 17 consecutive months up until that point.\n\n\"The industry's revenue decreased by 2 per cent. The net sales and net earnings of the major companies, including Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Abott India, decreased. Other publicly traded drug manufacturers also reported a single-digit reduction, demonstrating the extremely slow expansion of the pharmaceutical industry in India,\" Sodani observed.\n\n\"Low growth in the pharmaceutical industry on the basis of a few points: volumes fell for important treatments including antibiotics and supplements, a surplus of Covid-19 medicines in stock, a spike in raw material prices and lots more. The biggest challenge has been the expensive valuations in select pockets of pharma space where stocks went up three, or four times in a very short period of time because of Covid-led products driving or expected to drive their substantial growth,\" Sodani pointed out.\n\nSodani is positive about the Indian pharma players.\n\n\"The outlook is definitely positive for the pharma sector. We are expecting double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years. That should help in maintaining the valuations of the industry. Our expectation is that it will grow at around 10-11 per cent and there will be certain companies which will be growing faster than that also depending on the portfolio,\" said Sodani.\n\nHe said India is more of a structural growth story and it will remain so, which is why Indian pharma companies' valuations are at a much premium compared to the generic companies.\n\nSodani expects double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years which should help in maintaining the valuations and there will be some pockets in terms of companies who will be doing much better and that is why we are positive on select stocks.\n\nThe immense growth potential of the sector is a key positive for the sector.\n\nRead more: Indian Pharma industry expected to reach about 13% in global pharma market: Report\n\n\"139 new pharma projects worth ₹7,000 crore got the nod in FY23. According to the EY FICCI Report, the Indian pharmaceutical market is anticipated to reach $130 billion in value by the end of 2023 along with a few government policies which give direct benefits like Export Promotion Council for Medical Devices & National Medical Device Policy 2023,\" said Sodani.\n\n\"Picks from the pharma sector can be Zydus Life and Cipla for the mid to long-term for an upside of 10-15 per cent,\" Sodani said.\n\nRead all market-related news here",

            "title": "Growth vs. value, the age-old investing debate",
            "body": "There are two broad classifications for long-term equity investments: growth and value stocks.\n\nGrowth stocks are those that offer higher-than-market average growth in terms of earnings and revenue. They are generally characterised by high price-to-earnings ratios (reflecting the higher growth rate), low-cost structures due to network effects (hence lower capital requirements), low dividend yields and lower reliance on debt to fund capital requirements.\n\nTherefore, these companies tend to have manageable debt levels and raise capital predominantly through issuing equity rather than borrowing (lower cost of capital due to low dividend yields).\n\nValue companies\n\nOn the other hand, value companies tend to have higher working-capital requirements, greater reliance on borrowing to fund capital requirement, high dividend yields and low price-to-earnings ratios. They generally have lower profit margins than growth companies due to many factors. Value companies tend to operate in commodity markets (resembling perfect competition) rather than the technology industry leading to low product differentiation reducing pricing power (thus, lowering profit margins). Companies in India such as Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals and Vedanta fall in this category. These firms would prefer to fund capital requirement through borrowing rather than equity due to high capital requirements stemming from capital expenditure and working capital necessities.\n\nAlso read: PI Industries: Why investors can add on this stock\n\nSome exceptions\n\nThere are, however, exceptions to the rule with firms such as ITC, which have low debt and an average growth rate.\n\nOver the past decade, the interest rate in the U.S. had been next to zero leading to treasuries not being a viable option to yield returns. Value stocks, with low price-to-earnings ratio and high dividend yields, proved to be a way of capturing higher returns.\n\nGrowth stocks showed remarkable increases in revenue and profit but did not pose a great alternative to treasuries due to the low dividend yield. Moreover, growth stocks require one to engage in discounted cash-flow valuations (covered in an earlier piece), which prove to be scarcely reliable. A change in the discount rate by a few basis points leads to vastly differing company valuations. Additionally, it is difficult to accurately predict a company's growth percentages over a few years. Value stocks' earnings are not volatile and tend to be more predictable than growth stocks. Therefore, value stocks seemed like an attractive prospect to an investor looking to produce reliable returns.\n\nRising interest rates\n\nHowever, interest rates in the recent past have been rising, leading to the real debt of value companies to increase. The effect of rising interest rates on value companies can be seen as twofold.\n\nThe first effect is the curbing of inflation erosion in their value of debt (lower commodity prices), and the second effect is lower profit from muted economic activity. On the other hand, growth companies are not as adversely affected due to low borrowings and high free cash flow, notwithstanding the rise in interest rates.\n\nIn the past year, the U.S. has seen a resurgence in growth stocks despite layoffs and a decline in the performance of value stocks. The case for Indian investors stays entirely different to those in the U.S.\n\nAlso read: Tech Query: Canara Bank: Will the uptrend resume?\n\nIndian investors will find they do not have access to the growth companies mentioned above. Most high-growth companies in India (apart from a handful such as Infosys and Dr. Reddy's in the past) tend to prefer private equity funding rather than a public listing.\n\nFor example, companies such as Paperboat have made headway in the FMCG industry over the past decade and have chosen to remain privately owned. The supposed growth companies publicly listed in India, such as Nykaa, have done extremely poorly since listing. Others such as Zomato and Paytm are not worth mentioning, with negative profit and cash flows. Another problem Indian investors find is a lack of transparency in financial documents such as balance sheets (with some exceptions such as ITC and Tata firms), leading to poor decision-making.\n\nThe Indian retail investor, therefore, is left playing a value game without wanting to do so and must navigate a minefield of non-transparent balance sheets. However, the lack of access to growth stocks does not imply a lack of returns for the investor.\n\nOne must heed the advice of the erudite investor Howard Marks who stated that any asset is an excellent asset at the right price. The Indian investor stands to make exceptional returns through prudent and meticulous analysis of stocks and patiently waiting for appropriate prices.\n\n(Anand Srinivasan is a consultant, while Sashwath Swaminathan is a research assistant at Aionion Investment Services)\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 29, 2023",

            "title": "Value buys? These 20 Nifty stocks trading below 10-year PEs",
            "body": "NEW DELHI: While valuations on Dalal Street have fallen in line with 5-year and 10-year historical averages following a rangebound trade over the last two years, analysts believe they have still not fallen to levels that give investors comfort to put money aggressively. That said, nearly half of index stocks are below their 10-year averages and can offer decent returns to investors.\n\nTrendlyne data suggests these 20 stocks have 5-35% upside scope and hold to strong buy ratings from analysts.\n\nFor UPL, analysts have an average target upside of 35%. Out of 23 calls on the stock, 17 have strong buy ratings, 3 buy ratings, 2 hold calls and one sell call. UPL has a 12-month trailing PE of 14.03 times vs 10-year average PE of 17.32 times.\n\nBrokerage Prabhudas Lilladher recently slashed the FY24E/25E estimates for UPL by 16%/12% and target multiple from 14x earlier to 12x currently, to factor in subdued growth and margin outlook in the near term. It, however, maintained a BUY post the earnings show at a target of Rs 850.\n\nAs for Hindalco, its TTM PE stands at 7.92 times currently against the 10-year average of 12.52 times. The stock, which declared its Q4 earnings on Wednesday, has 14 strong buy out of 20 recommendations and no sell calls. It has an average upside scope of 30%, Trendlyne data further suggests.\n\nHDFC Bank, SBI, Axis Bank and M&M are also below their 10-year average while they have an upside scope of over 20% each in the next 12 months. This is when these stocks have gained 20-37% in the last one year already.\n\nHDFC Bank's counterpart HDFC is also trailing its 10-year average PE of 20.17 times as stock trades at 19.11 times. With the merger between the two entities just 4-5 weeks away, analysts on Thursday said the move would result in a lower net interest margin (NIM) for the lender this year.\n\nThe bank expects NIM - a key profitability measure - to fall to 3.7%-3.8% in 2023-24 from 4.1% a year ago due to the merger, Nomura analysts wrote in a report.\n\nNTPC, Apollo Hospitals, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Dr. Reddy's Labs and ONGC are among companies that are trading at a PE multiple of below their historical average. Analysts expect them to give gains in the high to mid-teens.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

            "body": "Mumbai: PAD Group, an established & integrated communications agency that is running creative, digital, and production services for brands announces the launch of its branded content venture - Hotcult. Hotcult aims to cultivate culture to produce distinctive human experiences that have a long-lasting influence on behaviour by focusing on culture, consumption, and commerce; its proprietary concept - is 'connecting loculturally'. The company is headquartered in Mumbai with offices in Hyderabad and Bangalore.\n\nHotcult will be positioned as a GLOCUL and LOCUL solutions provider, catering to a diverse country like India, i.e. Bharat, with a deeper understanding and expertise of the cultural landscape. Whether it's through TVCs, short or long-format videos, immersive digital experiences, or authentic influencer collaborations, Hotcult shall enable brands to not just relate but resonate with their target audiences, driving engagement, loyalty, and business growth.\n\nPAD Group CEO and founder Gautam Reddy, commented on the launch, said, \"When it comes to advertising, the one-size-fits-all strategy is slipping to the side-lines. The idea now is to think locally and culturally to ensure that any communication is current and timeless. The changing landscape is a testament to the fact that culture and authentic representation is of utmost importance. Trends and countertrends may come and go, but culture always finds a new shape and form to prevail. Hotcult's expertise lies in bringing out these hidden gems and fusing them with brand strategy in a very symbiotic manner, to create campaigns of great impact.\"\n\nHotcult shall be creatively led by Rupesh Kashyap, known for his culturally nuanced, rooted, and yet contemporary strategies and concepts. He is the writer behind the classic \"Swami-Savithri\" ad film made for Green Plywood in 2005, which became the inspiration for the recently released Malayalam movie \"Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam.\" probably the first of its kind where an ad film inspired the plot of a movie. He was instrumental in the launch of Disney Hotstar in South India. In his previous role, he assisted Aha with rebranding and drove the development of the premium service Aha Gold.\n\nElaborating on this, chief content officer Rupesh Kashyap, \"Hotcult, as the name implies, is focused on making brands HOT with culturally nuanced stories. Hotcult will fill a critical gap in the market for creative services of an agency that understands the pulse of Bharat. While the majority of national brands only talk about connecting locally through language, we take a true hyper-local approach with culture, highlighting how 'culture drives consumption' and 'belief drives behaviour'. The idea is to connect with the audience 'loculturally'- whether through retail experiences, product experiences, content, or any other brand experience medium.\"\n\nHotcult, with its extensive expertise, shall combine data-driven insights and innovation with a deep understanding of culture and a relentless focus on delivering exceptional results.\n\nThe agency's commitment to linguistic diversity - Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, and English shall ensure that the content reaches and resonates with a wide range of audiences, fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity.\n\nWith over a decade of experience, PAD has worked with some of the finest national brands across sectors. The agency has serviced over 300 clients, which include Paytm, Dabur, Ecolink by Philips, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate, Viacom 18, Mantri, Raheja Mindspace, Holland & Barrett, Grenade India, Ratnadeep Retail, My Home Group, Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions, Narayana Educational Institutions, Star Maa, Zee Telugu, AHA and many more.",

            "title": "Top 10 Best Biotechnology Companies In India In 2023 - Inventiva",
            "body": "Biotechnology has become an increasingly important industry in India over the last decade, with a growing number of biotechnology companies now operating in the country. These companies are working to bring innovative products and services to the Indian market, as well as creating jobs and contributing to the nation's economic growth.\n\nIn 2023, the biotechnology industry in India is expected to grow significantly, with a number of new companies entering the market. Many of these companies are focused on developing novel treatments for healthcare-related issues, such as cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases. Other companies are researching new technologies and products related to agriculture, energy, food, and water.\n\nGovernment initiatives to spur innovation have also helped encourage the growth of the biotechnology industry in India. The startup program 'Startup India' was launched in 2016 to help foster innovation and entrepreneurship in India, providing grants, loans, and other incentives to help startups get off the ground. In addition, the government has offered tax incentives to investors who fund biotechnology companies in the country.\n\nThe biotechnology sector in India is likely to continue to expand in the coming years, with more companies entering the market and existing ones continuing to develop innovative solutions.\n\nIndia is becoming an attractive destination for biotechnology investments due to its large population, highly-skilled talent pool, and favourable government policies. With the right support and resources, India has the potential to become a leader in biotechnology.\n\nIMPORTANCE\n\nBiotechnology is becoming increasingly important in India in 2023. The country has made great strides in biotechnological research and advancements, with a focus on developing new treatments and cures for various diseases.\n\nAdditionally, biotechnological companies are playing an essential role in the development of agricultural technologies to help increase yields and reduce costs for farmers.\n\nFurthermore, biotechnological companies are also exploring ways to use renewable energy sources for generating electricity and providing clean drinking water for people.\n\nThe Indian government has introduced several initiatives in this sector, such as the National Biotech Development Plan, which aims to develop human resources, infrastructure and other aspects of biotechnology.\n\nThis plan has been implemented in many states across India, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. Moreover, the Government of India has announced that it will invest Rs. 600 billion (US$8.2 billion) during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2012-2017).\n\nFurthermore, the government has established a number of biotechnology parks in India, which have become hubs for biotechnological research and development. These biotechnology parks have attracted some of the leading biotechnology companies from around the world, including Merck, Pfizer and Biocon.\n\nAdditionally, the government has set up a Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), which provides financial and technical assistance to biotechnology startups and SMEs in India.\n\nAll these steps taken by the government and industry show that biotechnology is becoming a rapidly growing sector in India.

            "title": "Global Small Molecule API Market Report 2023: Growing Demand for Small Molecule Drugs Fuels the Sector ",
            "body": "This report provides strategists, marketers and senior management with the critical information they need to assess the market.\n\nThe global small molecule API market is expected to grow from $180.67 billion in 2022 to $193.62 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. The small molecule API market is expected to grow to $246.18 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.2%.\n\nMajor players in the small molecule api market are Merck & Co., Inc., AbbVie, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Albemarle Corporation, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Viatris Inc., Aurobindo Pharma, Cambrex Corporation, Lonza, Siegfried AG, AstraZeneca, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., AND Nanjing King-Friend Biochemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\n\nReasons to Purchase\n\nSmall molecules API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) refers to organic components that have a low molecular weight of less than 1 nm and are typically made up of 20-100 atoms. These are active ingredients found in a wide range of biological and pharmaceutical procedures. Small molecules can be used as research tools to investigate biological function and to help develop new therapeutic agents. The small molecule API are used in pharmaceuticals and biological procedures.\n\nThe main types of small molecule API include Synthetic and biotech. Synthetic refers to a molecule that has been synthesised in a laboratory using various chemical processes. The different small molecule API manufacturing include in-house and outsourced, used for applications in cardiology, oncology, CNS and neurology, orthopaedic, endocrinology and other applications.\n\nStrategic partnership is a key trend in the small-molecule API market. Many companies operating in the small-molecule API market are undergoing partnerships to strengthen their position in the small-molecule API market and advance the development of various drugs and therapies.\n\nIn March 2022, GHO Capital, a European specialist investor in healthcare companies, acquired a majority stake in Sterling Pharma Solutions. With this acquisition, GHO Capital will facilitate the extensive sectoral pharmaceutical expertise in Europe and expand its market share in the U.S. Sterling Pharma Solutions is a US-based manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the small molecule API market in 2022. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the small molecule API market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe countries covered in the Small Molecule API market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA.\n\nThe growing demand for small-molecule drugs is expected to propel the growth of the small-molecule API market. Small-molecule drugs refer to low-molecular-weight compounds that can modulate biochemical processes to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Aspirin, diphenhydramine, and other molecules commonly found in medicine cabinets are examples of small-molecule drugs. These molecule drug products come under the category of small molecule API products, which help in preventing disease.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in 2021, 75% of the drugs accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were small molecules, with the dominant therapeutic area being oncology. Over 50% of these approvals were from small and mid-sized companies, which require support from CDMOs for the commercialization of products that contribute to the growth of CDMOs. Therefore, the growing demand for small-molecule drugs is driving the growth of the small-molecule API market.\n\nThe small molecules API market consists of sales of contract and captive small molecules API. Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers) or directly to end customers. The value of goods in this market includes related services sold by the creators of the goods.\n\nThe market value is defined as the revenues that enterprises gain from the sale of goods and/or services within the specified market and geography through sales, grants, or donations in terms of the currency (in USD, unless otherwise specified).\n\nThe revenues for a specified geography are consumption values that are revenues generated by organizations in the specified geography within the market, irrespective of where they are produced.

Our largest finished dosages factory was recognized by the World Economic Forum as part of its Global Lighthouse Network. These recognitions are an endorsement of our commitment to building a sustainable, high-performance organization focused on the needs of patients as well as society. I am excited about how far we have come in the past few years and by the opportunities we have for the future, as we continue to make efforts to bring to life our credo of 'Good Health Can't Wait'. With this, I'd like to hand over the call to Parag for taking you through the financial performance of the company. Page 2 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nParag Agarwal: Thank you, Prasad. Greetings to all of you and I hope all of you are doing well. I am delighted to take you through our results for the quarter 4 and full year of fiscal 2023. FY23 has been a year of strong financial performance with the highest ever sales, record profitability and robust cash flow generation from operations. Let me provide you with a quick rundown of our Q4 and FY23 financials. For this section, all the amounts are translated into U.S. dollar at a convenience translation rate of INR82.19, which is the rate as of 31st March 2023. Consolidated revenues for the quarter stood at INR6,297 crores, that is U.S. $766 million and grew by 16% on year-on-year basis and declined by 7% on a sequential quarter basis. Year-on-year growth was driven by growth in both generics and PSAI businesses. This was further augmented with income from divestment of a few non-core brands in India. Quarter-on-quarter decline was primarily due to sales volatility in the NAG business. The revenues for the financial year 2023 stood at INR24,588 crores, that is U.S. $2.99 billion and grew by 15%. The growth was mainly driven by new product launches, partly offset with price erosion. Consolidated gross profit margin for this quarter has been 57.2%, an increase of approximately 430 bps over previous year and decline of 210 bps on quarter-on-quarter basis. Year-on-year increase was driven by new product sales with higher gross margins and favourable foreign exchange. Quarter-on-quarter decline was primarily due to product mix and lower operating leverage, although partly offset by divestment income. Gross margins for the global generics and PSAI were at 61.7% and 25.2% for the quarter. Gross margin for FY23 has been 56.7%, which is an increase of 360 bps over FY22. The increase was driven by new product sales with higher gross margins, higher government incentives and favourable foreign exchange, partly offset with the impact of price erosion. Gross margins for the global generics and PSAI were at 62.1% and 16.2% for the year. The SG&A spend for the quarter is INR1,799 crores, that is U.S. $219 million and increased by 15% YoY, while it remained flat quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year increase is largely on account of sales and marketing investments and adverse impact of forex translation. The SG&A spend for the year is INR6,803 crores, that is U.S. $828 million and has grown by 10%. The SG&A cost as a percentage to sales was 27.7% and is lower by 130 bps over previous year due to better operating leverage. The R&D spend for the quarter is INR5,37 crores, that is U.S. $65 million and is at 8.5% of sales. Our R&D efforts are focused towards building a healthy pipeline of new products across our markets, including biosimilars. The R&D spent for FY23 is INR1,938 crores, that is U.S. $236 million. R&D percentage to sales for the year stood at 7.9%. The EBITDA for the quarter is INR1,631 crores, that is U.S. $198 million and the EBITDA margin is 25.9%. The EBITDA for the year is INR7,308 crores, that is U.S. $889 million. Page 3 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nEBITDA margin for the year is at 29.7%, which is ahead of our aspirational target of 25%. Our profit before tax for the quarter stood at INR1,326 crores, that is U.S. $161 million and that for the year stood at INR6,037 crores, that is U.S. $734 million. Our profit before tax for the quarter grew by 434% year on year and for the year it grew by 87%. Effective tax rate has been at 27.6% for the quarter and at 25.3% for the year. The effective tax rate was lower in FY23 largely due to changes in the company's jurisdictional mix of earnings. We expect our normal ETR to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Profit after tax for the quarter stood at INR959 crores, that is U.S. $117 million and that for the year stood at INR4,507 crores, that is U.S. $548 million. Reported EPS for the quarter is INR57.62 and that for the year is INR270.85. Operating working capital reduced by INR364 crores, which is U.S. $44 million, against that on December 31st, 2022, mainly supported by an improvement in receivables. Our capital investment stood at INR258 crores, which is U.S. $31 million in this quarter and INR1,132 crores, which is U.S. $138 million during the year. The free cash flow generated during this quarter was at INR1,596 crores, which is U.S. $194 million. The free cash flow generated during this year was at INR4,009 crores, which is U.S. $488 million. Consequently, we now have a net surplus cash of INR5,046 crores, that is U.S. $614 million as on March 31st, 2023. Foreign currency cash flow hedges in the form of derivatives for the U.S. dollar are approximately U.S. $774 million, largely hedged around the range of INR82.4 to INR84.5 for the dollar, RUB 7,380 million at the rate of INR1.045 to the ruble, and Australian dollar 4.2 million at the rate of INR57.8 Australian dollar, maturing in the next 12 months. With this, I now request Erez to take you through the key business highlights. Erez Israeli: Thank you Parag. Good morning and good evening to everyone. As Prasad highlighted, we have delivered strong financial performance in FY23. We closed the financial year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth, with EBITDA and ROCE margin exceeding the 25% levels. This impressive performance was reflected in our cash flow, and we continue to have a strong balance sheet. We progressed well on our strategic priorities and were able to invest in our organic capabilities and business development opportunities to thrive and deliver on our purpose over the long term. Let me take you through some of the key highlights of the year. 1. We witnessed underlying growth momentum in FY23 across all businesses, adjusted for COVID products' contribution during last year. 2. Revenue in North America Generics and in Branded markets of India and EM crossed the $1 billion mark for the second consecutive year. 3. We divested certain non-core brands in India to focus on strengthening the core. 4. Our EBITDA is at 30%, and our ROCE is at 35%. 5. We generated a strong free cash flow, leading to a net cash surplus of $614 million. 6. We also see positive momentum on BD/M&As with acquisition of Novartis Cardiovascular brand in India, Mayne Pharma's U.S. generic prescription product portfolio, and Eton's branded and generic injectable products in the United States. Page 4 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\n7. Significant progress also made in our biosimilar businesses. We see a launch of biosimilar Stimufend which is Pegfilgrastim by Fresenius KABI in the U.S. We completed and we saw the completion of clinical studies of Rituximab biosimilars, and we already filed in U.S., Europe, and the UK MHRA. We saw the completions of phase one study of biosimilar tocilizumab, and global phase three study was initiated. 8. Recently we received approvals for three products in China, namely Sevelamer, Sitagliptin, and Carboprost, and our partners got GEA approval for Nicergoline tablets. 9. We are also progressing well in our digitalization, as well as our ESG journey. 10. Our diversified global presence, capability, and strong balance sheet make us a partner of choice. We continue to work towards strengthening our position as a partner of choice, including in horizon two spaces. From a horizon two perspective, we signed some strategic licensing deals in April 23, including the below a. With Cardiacare for their wearable for atrial fibrillation treatment b. With Theranica for the wearable in management of migraine c. With the New Zealand based WZTL to bring the third generation CAR T asset for clinical trials in India d. With Junshi Bioscience to bring Toripalimab to India and other markets. We are investing in development and trials of these DTX, CAR T, biosimilar assets in keeping with our stated horizon two strategy. We see them as a future growth drivers. Now let me take you through the key business highlights for the Q4 and FY23. Please note that all the reference to the numbers in this section are in respective local currencies. Our North America generic business recorded sales of $312 million for the quarter, with a strong growth of 18% year over year and 17% decline on sequential basis. On a full year basis, we recorded sales of $1,268 million, with a growth of 26% over the previous year. This growth was largely led by new product launches such as Lenalidomide, Sorafenib tablets and Timolol gel, and growing market share in certain key existing products, which more than offset increased price erosion. We launched 6 products during the quarter and overall 25 products during the year. We expect the launch momentum to further improve in FY24. Our Europe business recorded sales of Euro 56 million this quarter, with year over year growth of 7% and sequential quarter growth of 9%. On a full year basis, the sales are Euro 210 million and has grown by 9%, driven by base business volume and new product launches. We launched 5 new products during the quarter and 35 for the full year in Europe across all markets. We expect this launch momentum to continue in FY 24. Our Emerging Market business recorded sales of Rs 1,114 crores, with year over year decline of 7% and sequential quarter decline of 15%. On a full year basis, Emerging Market sales have been roughly flat at Rs 4,553 crores. However, the sales have grown by 13%, adjusted for the COVID-related products and divestment income in FY22. We launched 10 new products during the quarter and 94 new products during the year across various countries of the Emerging Markets. Within the EM segments, the Russia business in Q4 declined by 34% on a year to year basis and 17% on a QoQ basis in constant currency. In FY23, Russia business declined by 9% in constant currency. The decline is attributable to divestment of few non-core brands during the previous year. During the year, there has been normalization in the channel/customer stocking level after the uptick seen in Q4 FY22.We have been navigating the evolving geopolitical uncertainties and have managed the ruble currency fluctuation with effective hedging. Page 5 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nOur India business recorded Q4 sales of INR1,283 crores with a year over year growth of 32% and sequential increase of 14%. On a full year basis, our sales were INR4,893 crores with a growth of 17%. Excluding the benefits of the divestment income and adjusted for COVID-19 related products, the year over year sales growth for the quarter has been 11% and for the full year has been 13%. As per the IQVIA report, we are ranked number 10 at MAT March'23 level. India remains our priority market and we are committed to continue to grow this business at a healthy rate. Our PSAI business recorded sales of $95 million with a year over year decline of 4% and flat sequentially. On a full year basis, the sales were $362 million with a decline of 12%. The decline was primarily due to high base effect of COVID related products. We expect this business to grow during FY24. Our R&D efforts are focused on developing value, accretive products including several generic injectables and biosimilars where there is a patient need. We have done 195 global generic filings including 12 ANDAs filed in the U.S. and 130 drug master files filed globally including 12 drug master files in the U.S, during FY23 and are on track to accelerate on this in FY24. We are progressing well in development of our biosimilar products and working on some niche opportunities in our Horizon 2 initiatives. Our strong balance sheets provide financial flexibility to support future growth, invest in business development opportunities, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to cash management and acquisitions. We continue to focus on optimizing workplace efficiency and productivity. We remain focused on strengthening our core generics and API business and delivering more from strong foundation. We are building a pipeline of products to meet the evolving needs of patients and healthcare professionals through investments in internal R&D as well as strategic acquisitions. With this, I would like to open the floor for questions-and-answers. Moderator: The first question is from the line of Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Balaji Prasad: Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail around your deals with just discussing what the responsibilities will look like on both ends. And just what really convinced you about their asset and its potential? Thanks. Parag Agarwal: Balaji, we were not able to hear you well. I'm afraid you will have to repeat the question. Erez Israeli: Can you repeat, please? Balaji Prasad: Sure. Is this better? Can you hear me better now? Erez Israeli: Yes, please. Page 6 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nBalaji Prasad: This is Michella on behalf of Balaji. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail around your deal with Junshi just discussing what responsibilities will look like on both ends. And also, just wondering what convinced you about just their asset and its potential. Erez Israeli: So strategically, we are looking for unmet need, especially in India. And we believe and we are in a great dialogue with the innovation industry in China, and we are trying to bring products that we believe that we can bring value and we believe that this product showed very, very nice results and can be absolutely considered standard for sale and where we can bring it to India in a very affordable prices versus the alternatives. And this is our purpose. We are trying to bring a great help in the affordability terms. And that was the main incentive behind this deal. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Surya Patra from PhilipCapital. Surya Patra: Congratulations for the great set of numbers, sir. Sir, my first question is on the U.S. business front. So, is it possible to share that what is the sequential growth in the U.S. that we would have seen of ex of Revlimid in the current quarter? Erez Israeli: So, we cannot give guidance per product with or without, you know very well. What I can say is that we are very consistent. So likely we are going to continue to see growth in all of our spaces including the United States with and without the product. And it will be driven primarily for the organic activities, specifically for the United States, besides the Revlimid, we are going to launch somewhere between 25 to 30 products as well as the contribution of our recent acquisitions and likely that we will see also additional activity through the year. Surya Patra: Sir, is it possible to give some extra colour on the launch momentum that you have mentioned in your opening remarks for the U.S. market, which you believe that to be strong in the current financial year? Erez Israeli: Yes, I think that the investment in R&D and especially on products that hopefully or likely to have less competition than the others is paying off. And as well as the type of patent fleet that we will see in FY '24 as well as the years after. So right now, that's the numbers that I mentioned, 25 to 30 products can be meaningful launches with a lesser of a competition. And we will continue to accumulate this kind of products also in the years after. So, it's absolutely our strategy in the U.S., and we will continue to focus on that. Surya Patra: Sir, my second question is on the composite question, let's say. We are seeing a strong cash accumulation and simultaneously, we are seeing multiple M&A activities by us to improve our focus on the domestic formulation business, which has now achieved around 20% of the total revenue base. And we are mentioning that this is going to be one of the focus market for us? So, could you share your thought process, sir, on the kind of capital allocation to build this business in the near future? And ultimately, what is the kind of a business mix that you want to make, achieve it for domestic formulation considering the potential sales growth and all that, if you can share. Erez Israeli: Yes, absolutely. So, in India, our primary growth will come from, one, focusing on our brands. We identified focus therapeutic areas as well as the focus brands. And we have doubled down on that by increasing our footprint by going to more cities, etcetera. So, this is one growth, specifically to your question. The second one is that we are collaborating with the innovation industry in the United States, in Israel, in China and other places as well, of course, with companies and institutes in India to bring innovation to India. We are doing it as both with our own internal R&D as well as with external R&D. Page 7 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nSome of the deals, I mentioned in my script and more to come. We are doing it both on Horizon 1 as well as Horizon 2. And our path of growth is people see us as a very attractive partner being compliant with all the international norms, given our reputation in the marketplace, and we are leveraging it to bring more and more innovation into India. And that's also part of the capital allocation will go to a deals like this. In addition, we are always looking for opportunity also for acquisitions. There is nothing that we can report at this stage. But it's absolutely something that we are open to do all the time. For the initial part of the capital allocation, all of our spaces, including U.S., Europe, India, etcetera, our B2B business, we are looking for potential complementary deals. The type of deals that we are looking for is complementary. We are looking for products that we don't have or capabilities that we don't have. Unlikely that you are going to see megadeals or this kind of stuff. This is not our comfort zone. We are looking for primarily unmet needs or complementary products that will fit our portfolio in that way. Surya Patra: So that is really great to know. And just lastly, any colour that you can add to the Pegfilgrastim expectations in the progress post launch? Erez Israeli: Sorry yes, the product, as you know, is marketed by Fresenius. I don't have any expectation of anything like that, we as a partner, have a certain arrangement with them and if they will be successful, we will be successful as well. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Damayanti Kerai from HSBC. Please go ahead. Damayanti Kerai: My first question is on the U.S. business; you have been obviously very consistent in terms of new launches. But can you talk a bit more about the kind of price erosion, which we are seeing in your existing product? And my second part of the question is compared to oral solids in injectables, what kind of price erosion you are witnessing? Erez Israeli: So, the nature of the U.S. did not change in the last quarter. It's a similar structure of the market and similar behaviour of players. Specifically for the quarter, the mix of products that we had, we saw less of a price erosion that will be quarters before, but the fundamental structure of the market did not change. So likely that when we will face competition in certain products, then we'll see an erosion that's the nature. But specifically, we saw a better mix this time. Comparing injectables to oral solid, both are very competitive. It's more of a function of how many players are attracting the customers and so both injectable as well as oral solids can see a high level of erosion, but also from time-to-time product with less competition and therefore better pricing situation. Page 8 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nDamayanti Kerai: My second question is, as you continue to invest in your business and long-term growth drivers, how do you see R&D and SG&A costs moving from here on? And you obviously have done better than your aspirational EBITDA margin for this year. But on a more sustained basis, how do you see this like margin trajectory moving? Erez Israeli: So, we are maintaining the 25-25 as a long term, and we discussed it in previous meetings, and there will be years and quarters that we will exceed it. There will be maybe also year that it will be below, which has happened also in the past. But we are very much there. What we are doing is that we are allocating the extra results that we invest. And especially in R&D, the R&D likely to be somewhere between 8% to 9% also going forward. And it's naturally nominal will grow because we are growing the sales, and this is allowing us to invest in the biologics, it allows us to invest in products that we are partners with other and we need to do some clinical trials. And of course, very important on the generic R&D, especially focusing on products that are likely to have less competition. Moderator: We have the next question from the line of Neha Manpuria from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Neha Manpuria: On the ROW markets, historically, if I exclude the last year because of COVID impact, we have grown that market north of 20% or 25%. As we go forward, should we see the ROW market going back to those levels of growth. And this is the excluding Russia. That's my first question. And second, on the India business, could you quantify the divestment income in the current quarter? And excluding that, how should we look at growth? Is there more divestment that we see from the India perspective? Or do you think this is based on which we should grow? And do you think you can grow in line with the market in India? Erez Israeli: On the ROW question yes, the answer is yes. We are aiming for our traditional growth and also give or take without guidance, that range of growth that we saw. And indeed, when you are taking out all the one-offs and the fluctuation of currency, we are growing very, very nicely. This is primarily as we are accelerating the development and the filings of products in all these markets and also focusing on the footprint, especially on the hospital business. So yes, the answer is that we will see growth and some of those markets with an accelerated growth versus the past. As for India, the divestment was INR264 crores, and that's the value we've got. And specifically, we see more, yes, from time to time, but nothing significant that we are going and what we are also very busy with is actually to bring more and more products, and we are enhancing the collaboration discussions and the BD deals that will be for India. So, it's a kind of organic plus inorganic. But most of the inorganic will come from collaboration rather than kind of M&A acquisitions of other companies. Neha Manpuria: And just to extend the India question, do you think we can grow in line with the market, keeping aside the collaborations, etcetera, because that would take time to reflect the numbers just from the effort that we have been putting in the business over the last few years. Could we see Reddy's go back to or at least try to get in line with IPM growth? Page 9 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nErez Israeli: We believe that we should be better than the IPM growth. Neha Manpuria: In FY24, itself? Erez Israeli: In FY24 and after. Neha Manpuria: And one last question, if I may. On the Russia business, I didn't quite catch what you mentioned in the quarter. Was there any specific impact from channel inventory being cleared in the quarter? I'm not sure what you mentioned. Parag Agawwal: So, Neha, the impact is actually in the base, if you remember when the conflict started at that time, we have said that yes, there was up stocking. And to that extent, in Q4, same time last year, the base was high, and that's impacting the year-on-year growth. Neha Manpuria: There's nothing specifically in this quarter? Erez Israeli: Yes. So, nothing specific happened in this quarter. And most of the sequential decline stuff primarily timing of product. There is a specific timing of tenders of the biologic products and stuff like that. So, we can sell that in Russia business as usual. Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ankush Mahajan from Axis Securities. Ankush Mahajan: So, my question is related to the gRevlimid that has an incremental revenue for U.S. business. So, could you throw some light on it? What is the sustainability run rate for this molecule in upcoming quarters? And excluding this gRevlimid, how do you see the EBITDA margins for the U.S. business? Erez Israeli: So, on the product, we want it to continue to be meaningful product and may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but - it is going to be there probably for the entire agreement timelines. The fluctuation is primarily patterns of ordering, but we as you know, it's a limited volume arrangement, and we believe that it will serve us well to the entirety of the agreement. As for the activities outside of it, it's going to continue to grow. I mentioned in your previous discussion, all the time we have products that have less competition than others. Naturally this product is bigger than the other, but likely, because in the future, we are going to see products like that. And that's what we are also focusing on so the profitability as well as the growth of our U.S. markets will continue to be in the same range also in the years to come and quarters to come. Ankush Mahajan: And sir, what are the EBITDA margins that we - sustainable EBITDA margins? Erez Israeli: Like I mentioned, we are going to sustain the 25-25 on a long-term basis. We are not guiding for EBITDA per market, as you know. And from time to time, it will be more than that and it will be maybe times about it in terms of a function of how much we want to put into the R&D, likely that there will be higher through the time that we will have Revlimid and the combination of other low competitive products. Page 10 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nAnkush Mahajan: So, if I do my calculations and we're excluding Revlimid, base business is still on the lower side in terms of growth. So, any strategy for the base business? Erez Israeli: I don't share that observation. Ankush Mahajan: Thank you, sir. Thanks. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Kunal Dhamesha: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So, the first question on strategy to leverage our U.S.-generic portfolio for Europe and other markets. And we have seen significant growth in Europe geography over the last two, three years. But in your view, how far along we are in that journey? Let's say in U.S., we have roughly around 140 products, 150 products. How many products we would have already launched in Europe? How many in pipeline? And if you can throw some light there, it would be helpful? Erez Israeli: Yes, we decided to focus on Europe when we took the decision on the diversification. This is working well for us. And in terms of where are we in the journey, somewhere in the beginning. So I do see that most of the growth in Europe are ahead of us. We are planning to launch many products in Europe in the next coming years, as well as to make other moves, including inorganic. So, we see Europe as a focus market, especially around Germany. So, Germany will be the focal market. And of course, the rest of the big countries in Europe, we believe that we have to offer, including biosimilars. So likely that you continue to see growth in Europe also in the next coming years, including next year. Kunal Dhamesha: And this leveraging of portfolio when you launch same product, does it become highly ROIC-accretive in your view, even beyond what our aspirational target is, or it helps us achieve that 25% ROIC target? On a portfolio level, product portfolio. Erez Israeli: Yes, absolutely. Because it's primarily leverage. And obviously, it's a piece in the puzzle. Europe is still relatively small compared to the other spaces. But over the time, it's getting more-and-more positive impact on the overall average. But it's a good thing. Kunal Dhamesha: Sure. And the second question on the CTO-1 observation. What's the kind of nature of observation? And have we submitted the response to U.S. FDA? Or are we in the process of submitting a response? Erez Isreali: It's a minor observation. We will address it. And we did not submit it yet. We just got it. I think we have 15 days, if I'm not mistaken. So, we will submit it on time. I believe that this will be helpful. Kunal Dhamesha: Sure. Thank you, and all the best. Erez Israeli: Thank you. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Madhav Marda from FIL Industries. Please go ahead. Page 11 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nMadhav Marda: Hi, good evening. Thank you so much for your time. Just had one question. Basically, we've accumulated a lot of free cash flow in recent times. And I think have been doing some M&A activity already. Just wanted to understand, given I think in general, a lot of the peers have good free cash flows and net cash balance sheets in the industry. So, when we're looking at M&A, aren't good assets very aggressively bid? We've seen that in the past as well in the industry. I just want to understand that for a good asset, is it easy to get it at a good IRR, or how should we think about M&A opportunities, given we have a good cash balance available today? Erez Israeli: Yes, so if you recall, it was part of our strategy to close the debt and accumulate cash, anticipating this situation, anticipating at the time, the increase in the interest rate and inflation. So, we are now looking for opportunities that one, will of course fit us strategically, and second, will be in good valuation. So now I think there are certain areas and certain type of products that potentially can get a good multiples. And that's what we are looking for. In addition to that, we are looking for, we are using this money for the type of licensing and type of boosting the portfolio also for the future. And the money will be used also for that. We are not the type of company that is seeking what you call transformational acquisitions that are unlikely that you'll see in our case. But we will see, hopefully, more deals than we saw in the past. Madhav Marda: So basically, our M&A will be more bolt-on, the kind that we've done in recent times as well. That's the idea? Erez Israeli: Let's call it business development, which is including licensing and we'll include the product acquisitions, collaboration with companies, and also M&A. Madhav Marda: Got it. Okay, thank you. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Cyndrella Thomas Carvalho from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Cyndrella Carvalho: Thanks for the opportunity. So, I just wanted to clarify this. Sorry for asking on generic Revlimid again. But is the higher volume share reflected in this quarter, or will it be reflected next quarter? Erez Israeli: If you're talking about the Lenalidomide, we cannot share quantity numbers. And what I said is it continues to be meaningful to us and in accordance to the agreement terms that we have. Cyndrella Carvalho: Okay, thank you. And in your opening remarks, you highlighted about the Chinese product approvals that you have received. When and where should we start reflecting these into earnings? And what is our outlook here, if you can help us understand? Erez Israeli: Yes, this is a reflection of the efforts that we had through the years by submitting more products. And China focusing on those products since we can get GEA status and be one of the early entry for the market. So, I think getting product approvals in less than a couple of weeks is a big achievement for a company like us. What we see, we see pick-up all the time as a significant impact on our results. Page 12 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nWe will see more about, let's say, from starting in FY24, but more likely we'll see bigger numbers in FY25 and FY26 fiscal as the submissions and the approvals and the timing of those GPOs will take place. That's what we anticipate. And right now, we are in the pace of 15 product to 20 product submissions per year. And naturally, with the cycle of approvals that happened in China and the timing of the GPOs, it will be more meaningful. But let's say the strategy so far is working well because it's a leveraged strategy in which we have an outlet for the very, very important markets. We are very pleased from this approval. Cyndrella Carvalho: Thanks. This is helpful. And coming to the PSAI business, compared to your peers, we have not seen the top line growth. However, the gross margins have definitely improved Q-on-Q. So how should we see the outlook for this business? We've been positive on growing this business. But does anything change here at this point in time, or is it some seasonal impact that we have seen in this quarter, and we should start seeing growth from next fiscal onwards? How should we read this? Erez Israeli: We will see both. We will see growth and we will see improvement of profitability. For us, this market also in the past, and I'm excluding also in this segment, we used to record also COVID sales. So, if I'm excluding the COVID, what we saw is at that time, it was a decrease in prices of some of portfolio as well as increase in some of the raw material. Now we see the reverse. What we see that we are launching new products and most of the sales are to more territories, especially in Asia. And we see also a better mix of products. And we see an ease on the supply chain and to a certain extent procurement. So actually, now I see a positive momentum that is building on both growth as well as profitability. Cyndrella Carvalho: But we should see this gross margin level sustaining? Erez Israeli: I hope that it will be even enhanced, not just sustained for sure, but we are aiming for enhancing it. Cyndrella Carvalho: And the top line, any number that you would like to share, like only double digits, a mix double digits, anything, any color that can be helpful? Erez Israeli: No, we are aiming for double digits. We are not guiding, but we are aiming for double digits for all of our markets, including our PSAI. Cyndrella Carvalho: Thank you so much. I'll join back the queue. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tushar Manudhane from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Please go ahead. Tushar Manudhane: Yes, thanks for the opportunity. So again, on North America's sales, given that FY23 had a certain strength-related exclusivity as well for generic Revlimid and competition to some extent kicking in the coming quarters. So, considering these aspects, I just would like to understand, will we still grow in FY24 in U.S. sales, North America sales? Page 13 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nErez Israeli: I believe that we will grow not just because of the product. We will grow because we are also launching 25 to 30 products. And the combination of all that mix should grow up in the United States. Tushar Manudhane: Okay, sir. Thank you. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish S Thavkar from IIFL Asset Management. Please go ahead. Ashish Thavkar: Yes, thanks for the opportunity. So, I have this question since we have been maintaining this 25% EBITDA margin guidance. But if we just try to strip off one-time big opportunities and say some one-off non-recurring items, the EBITDA margins on the core business seem to be lower versus what we were earlier guiding for. So, if you could help us understand for FY24, as we're going to FY '24, would you like to provide some color as to directionally of what we as investors can expect? Erez Israeli: Yes, first, I don't share the observation that it's less than what we guide. So that's a starting point. And we may need to clarify it. We will be maintaining the 25-25 message on the long-term basis, in which we will allow us both to grow, give great return to the shareholder, as well as to finance the future. And what you see is that we are building a bigger and better portfolio as time goes by. And plus, the balance sheet is probably the best ever in terms of both cash flow, as well as no additional substantial risk that exists in the balance sheet. So, this is, of course, allowing us - much better, also, utilization of the working capital. So, this will allow us a better ROCE, also, in the future. Ashish Thavkar: Yes, fair enough. So lastly, on this India business, you did mention that FY24, you expect to beat the IPM growth. And we have been acquiring assets, trying to strengthen our portfolio. What gives you the confidence that FY24, we can beat the industry growth? We just wanted to have some understanding on that. Erez Israeli: I'm confident that we'll do it. And we need to recall that, for me, I know that we are looking at external sources, like IQVIA, et cetera. But the most important for me is what is our bottom-line growth. And that should be very healthy. So, the answer is that I am confident. And I believe that we will grow the bottom line even faster than we'll grow the top line. Ashish Thavkar: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, all the best. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Agarwal from DAM Capital Advisors. Please go ahead. Nitin Agarwal: Thanks for taking my question. It is on the Mayne portfolio that we acquired in the U.S. Can you give us some more color on what opportunities you see in that portfolio, in terms of to grow the portfolio from the current side? Erez Israeli: Yes, it's a portfolio that has a certain lower level of competition, especially in women health. It's allowed us to get back to women health, something that was missing for us, as you know, through the years. And it's also, there were many products in the pipeline that Mayne did not launch. And something that we'll be able to do in the future. So, if you wish, we have a triple impact. One, we believe that we can do well with this product. Second, we will be able to launch more products. And third, we can launch some of these products in other markets. And relatively, the economy of the deal is relatively attractive for us. So, we are very pleased so far with the progress of the main acquisition. Page 14 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nNitin Agarwal: So, I think it's fair to assume, given the new product launches that you have opportunities that you have, we see possibilities for growing the business from where we acquired it? Erez Israeli: That's what we are aiming to, yes. Nitin Agarwal: And from a profitability perspective, is this a business which is higher than our corporate profitability right now? Erez Israeli: I cannot share information about the specific profitability of products. But we believe that the nature of the products and the mix of the product that have less competition is always favorable versus those with a high level of competition. This is the nature of the business. Nitin Agarwal: And besides the acquisition that you made, the part of this investment that you made in the U.S. generics, do we still are open to investing more money in U.S. generics by way of acquisition? Or this is more of a special case transaction which came our way? Erez Israeli: We will continue to look for opportunity in the U.S. market, including generics, if it will fit the financials and if it will be complementary to what we do. So, we will continue to look for opportunities, both organic and inorganic, in the U.S., not just now also in the future. It is a very important market for us. Nitin Agarwal: Okay, sir, thank you. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead. Prakash Agarwal: Yes, hi, good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. If I heard that right, I just wanted to reconfirm that you mentioned that you expect double digit growth from across markets, including the U.S. Would that be correct? Erez Israeli: I do. Not necessarily every quarter and not necessarily all the time. But absolutely, this is the long-term aspiration for us. Absolutely, that's what we are aiming for in the short term. But I cannot promise you that it will happen every quarter and every product and every situation, obviously. Prakash Agarwal: So, asking for fiscal '24 specifically, sir? Erez Israeli: Specifically, that's what we are aiming. We are aiming for double digit growth. Prakash Agarwal: And excluding the acquisition with the base portfolio and some one-offs, it is possible, as what you see? Page 15 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nErez Israeli: I believe that it's possible. Prakash Agarwal: Okay. That is helpful. And just to follow-up on this, the U.S. generic market, I mean, many companies have been talking about while price erosion remains more or less similar, there is a lot of volume opportunities that is coming, new business opportunities, etcetera, so would you say that we would have also brought these in the last three, six months, given there's some U.S. FDA issues with the PSAI? Erez Israeli: I'm not sure I understand the FDA comment. Can you clarify that? Prakash Agarwal: Yes, so what we hear from some of the peers is that they are getting some volume opportunities, like new business opportunities, NBOs, where they need to supply a few of the products where earlier they were not contracted, largely due to the U.S. FDA issues by the peers. So, are we getting some volume-based opportunities to supply in the U.S. market? Erez Israeli: We do from time-to-time. I'm not considering it as a strategic issue, but we do from time-to-time have a situation. So, give or take, if I saw correctly, about 10% to 15% of the SKU in the United States in some sort of a shortage for all kinds of reasons, not just the FDA, but all kinds of reasons. And in those situations, you have always an opportunity for one-time buy and stuff like that. Prakash Agarwal: And have you seen anything incremental in the last quarter is what I'm trying to get some color on? I mean, given we have seen some large companies having some issues. Erez Israeli: Yes, so nothing that I see as strategic. In general, we are not building ourselves on the failures of others. We are trying to build ourselves with our own capabilities. Prakash Agarwal: Fair enough. And lastly, on the run rate that we see in the past, it was $225 million, and then it came back, the base business side to $250 million, and then we saw some big jumps. And now things are normalizing, and you still maintain it is going to be volatile, but material. And I also understand that market share of these Revlimid are, it changes, right? It increases every six, 12 months or maybe calendar year. So would it be fair to say that, with the new launches that you spoke about and Revlimid continuing, this is an addition to the first question. So that is the key to grow double digit. Would that be a fair assessment that on that Revlimid base also you will grow? Erez Israeli: The growth in the United States will be from new products, as well as volume from other products, as well as better costing. All of that will contribute, absolutely. But I cannot guide you on with and without or this kind of stuff. I will not be able to do that. Prakash Agarwal: Okay, lovely. And lastly, while you spoke about growth across markets, would you say with this kind of launch and product visibility across markets, these kind of margins could be sustainable? Erez Israeli: Yes, I believe so. I believe that that's why we are guiding for the 25-25, which will enable us even to finance Horizon 2. So, if you recall, we said that about 50 to 100 basis points on Horizon 2, and we are able to cater that within the margins. So, we are strategically positioned well that we are able to finance our future and at the same time to provide these margins and ROCE to the shareholders. Page 16 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nPrakash Agarwal: But we are doing better than what we are guiding, right? That's what I'm asking. Will we be able to continue with this kind of performance? Erez Israeli: Now we are doing better and maybe there will be also a period of time that will be not better, but right now we are doing better, yes. Prakash Agarwal: Okay, lovely. Thank you and all the best. Erez Israeli: Thank you. Moderator: Thank you. We will take that as our last question for today, ladies and gentlemen. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Richa Periwal for closing comments. Over to you, ma'am. Richa Periwal: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today for the earnings call. For any further queries, please reach out to the investor relations team. Thank you, have a great day. Moderator: Thank you. On behalf of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

            "title": "Curbing water usage in agriculture",
            "body": "A set of smart practices and technological interventions introduced as part of regenerative agriculture are ensuring that farmers not only reduce water usage but also get access to it. A report by Deepanwita Gita Niyogi\n\nFarmer Ramakrishna Mandala has three acres of land on which he cultivates paddy and maize. While paddy occupies two acres, maize is grown on the rest in both Kharif and Rabi seasons.\n\nMandala, who is in his forties, resides in Tirupati Palem village of Srikakulam, a coastal district in Andhra Pradesh, highly impacted by extreme weather events like cyclones. To add to problems, in the past 10 years, the rainfall pattern has changed in the region which has made farmers dependent on borewells for irrigation. The farmer has two borewells for watering his land.\n\nAs borewells draw out groundwater from aquifers, it is important to conserve and replenish this precious source in a changing climate when more droughts have been predicted. Smart farming practices can help reduce water usage in agriculture.\n\nPrior to 2017, Mandala used to follow traditional farming methods which did not focus on water conservation efforts. A few others, who thought about conserving water, also had no idea about how to go about it.\n\nSince 2017 onwards, thanks to technological interventions introduced by Hyderabad-based non-profit Dr. Reddy's Foundation, as part of regenerative agriculture, a change took place. By following water-saving techniques, Mandala was able to cover his entire land area of three acres as well as share water with other farmers in his village.\n\nSmart water use\n\nLast year, during a seminar at ICRISAT, which focuses mainly on dryland agriculture, experts discussed the benefits of regenerative farming in view of a changing climate.\n\nOne of the most important interventions under regenerative agriculture has been the introduction of direct seeded rice (DSR) which ensures throwing seeds in the field with the multi-crop planter machine. This replaced nursery preparation of growing seedlings and then transplanting them in flooded fields traditionally followed across India.\n\nAs DSR does not need standing water in fields, a lot of water is saved. In coastal Andhra Pradesh, paddy is the dominant crop along with maize. Sometimes a third crop such as oilseed is also grown in April. For maize too, direct seed sowing replaced ploughing, thus conserving water. This is being done with the double wheel marker.\n\nUnder regenerative agriculture, water usage is an important component, said Suman Reddy, associate director-operations, Dr. Reddy's Foundation.\"Apart from reducing water use in agriculture, no ploughing by tractors also saves fuel.\"\n\nCurrently, regenerative agriculture is on in 24 blocks of Srikakulam and adjoining Vizianagaram districts covering 1560 villages. As part of this, 1200 lead farmers and 21000 fellow farmers have been identified. Lead farmers selected in every village spread the good word and encourage others to follow suit.\n\nApart from DSR rice, soil moisture conservation in agroforestry set ups is also one of the smartest ways to reduce water usage. As part of it, farmers have introduced fruit trees in traditional coconut orchards. \"The aim is to cover the soil and not leave it barren. Farmers also start getting yields from the second year itself and do not have to wait for five years for coconut trees to bear fruits,\" said Lakshmi Narasimha Murthy, who works for the non-profit in Srikakulam.\n\nCover crops in agroforestry improve soil fertility. In Tirupati Palem village of Ranasthalam block, horse gram has been planted as a cover crop in the coconut orchard of farmer Venugopal Velichetti. The farmer has mango, lemon and guava trees in his orchard. Venugopal has 122 plants on 1.4 acres.\n\nSaving a precious resource\n\nFarmer Sathyam Sarika of Neliwada could not cover his entire three acres of land before due to the lack of adequate water. Now, the water level in his borewell has increased within 10 months. This has been possible through borewell recharge which harvests rainwater and sends it back to aquifers through natural filtration. It is another way to reduce water usage. Many farmers who failed to irrigate their lands before due to water shortage now find it easy with this method. This was introduced after due consultation with scientists from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra.\n\nIn Neliwada village, lead farmer Simhachalam Pandranki owns about five acres of land. \"Farmers try to conserve as much water as possible. DSR rice, borewell recharge and zero tillage in maize conserve water and it can be used for other purposes. Then there is the rain hose technology which irrigates lands quickly, thus saving water.\" Rain hose sprays water like rain and helps cover two acres in about two hours.\n\nAcross Srikakulam, many farmers have adopted water conservation measures in the face of a changing climate and cyclonic disturbances. They are reaping benefits too. Sanyasirao Reddy, who has three acres of land, does not need to water his fields daily now. In a week, five days are adequate. He is a resident of Venkateshwara Colony village.\n\n\"Regenerative agriculture is all about focusing on soil health and water conservation. While water use is reducing, access to water is increasing with rain hose technology and borewell recharge,\" Suman Reddy added. According to Murthy, much water used to be wasted in paddy transplantation. But DSR has managed to save water and give increased yields, even in some cases by five quintals more.",

With this, I'd like to hand over the call to Parag for taking you through the financial performance of the company.\n\nParag Agarwal:Thank you, Prasad. Greetings to all of you and I hope all of you are doing well. I am delighted to take you through our results for the quarter 4 and full year of fiscal 2023. FY23 has been a year of strong financial performance with the highest ever sales, record profitability and robust cash flow generation from operations. Let me provide you with a quick rundown of our Q4 and FY23 financials. For this section, all the amounts are translated into U.S. dollar at a convenience translation rate of INR82.19, which is the rate as of 31st March 2023. Consolidated revenues for the quarter stood at INR6,297 crores, that is U.S. $766 million and grew by 16% on year-on- year basis and declined by 7% on a sequential quarter basis. Year-on-year growth was driven by growth in both generics and PSAI businesses.\n\nThis was further augmented with income from divestment of a few non-core brands in India. Quarter-on-quarter decline was primarily due to sales volatility in the NAG business. The revenues for the financial year 2023 stood at INR24,588 crores, that is U.S. $2.99 billion and grew by 15%. The growth was mainly driven by new product launches, partly offset with price erosion. Consolidated gross profit margin for this quarter has been 57.2%, an increase of approximately 430 bps over previous year and decline of 210 bps on quarter-on-quarter basis. Year-on-year increase was driven by new product sales with higher gross margins and favourable foreign exchange.\n\nQuarter-on-quarter decline was primarily due to product mix and lower operating leverage, although partly offset by divestment income. Gross margins for the global generics and PSAI were at 61.7% and 25.2% for the quarter. Gross margin for FY23 has been 56.7%, which is an increase of 360 bps over FY22. The increase was driven by new product sales with higher gross margins, higher government incentives and favourable foreign exchange, partly offset with the impact of price erosion.\n\nGross margins for the global generics and PSAI were at 62.1% and 16.2% for the year. The SG&A spend for the quarter is INR1,799 crores, that is U.S. $219 million and increased by 15% YoY, while it remained flat quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year increase is largely on account of sales and marketing investments and adverse impact of forex translation.\n\nThe SG&A spend for the year is INR6,803 crores, that is U.S. $828 million and has grown by 10%. The SG&A cost as a percentage to sales was 27.7% and is lower by 130 bps over previous year due to better operating leverage. The R&D spend for the quarter is INR5,37 crores, that is U.S. $65 million and is at 8.5% of sales. Our R&D efforts are focused towards building a healthy pipeline of new products across our markets, including biosimilars. The R&D spent for FY23 is INR1,938 crores, that is U.S. $236 million. R&D percentage to sales for the year stood at 7.9%. The EBITDA for the quarter is INR1,631 crores, that is U.S. $198 million and the EBITDA margin is 25.9%. The EBITDA for the year is INR7,308 crores, that is U.S. $889 million.\n\nPage 3 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nEBITDA margin for the year is at 29.7%, which is ahead of our aspirational target of 25%. Our\n\nprofit before tax for the quarter stood at INR1,326 crores, that is U.S. $161 million and that for\n\nthe year stood at INR6,037 crores, that is U.S. $734 million. Our profit before tax for the quarter\n\ngrew by 434% year on year and for the year it grew by 87%.\n\nEffective tax rate has been at 27.6% for the quarter and at 25.3% for the year. The effective tax\n\nrate was lower in FY23 largely due to changes in the company's jurisdictional mix of earnings.\n\nWe expect our normal ETR to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Profit after tax for the quarter\n\nstood at INR959 crores, that is U.S. $117 million and that for the year stood at INR4,507 crores,\n\nthat is U.S. $548 million.\n\nReported EPS for the quarter is INR57.62 and that for the year is INR270.85. Operating working\n\ncapital reduced by INR364 crores, which is U.S. $44 million, against that on December 31st,\n\n2022, mainly supported by an improvement in receivables. Our capital investment stood at\n\nINR258 crores, which is U.S. $31 million in this quarter and INR1,132 crores, which is U.S.\n\n$138 million during the year. The free cash flow generated during this quarter was at INR1,596\n\ncrores, which is U.S. $194 million. The free cash flow generated during this year was at\n\nINR4,009 crores, which is U.S. $488 million. Consequently, we now have a net surplus cash of\n\nINR5,046 crores, that is U.S. $614 million as on March 31st, 2023.\n\nForeign currency cash flow hedges in the form of derivatives for the U.S. dollar are\n\napproximately U.S. $774 million, largely hedged around the range of INR82.4 to INR84.5 for\n\nthe dollar, RUB 7,380 million at the rate of INR1.045 to the ruble, and Australian dollar 4.2\n\nmillion at the rate of INR57.8 Australian dollar, maturing in the next 12 months. With this, I\n\nnow request Erez to take you through the key business highlights.\n\nErez Israeli:\n\nThank you Parag. Good morning and good evening to everyone. As Prasad highlighted, we have\n\ndelivered strong financial performance in FY23. We closed the financial year with double-digit\n\ntop line and bottom line growth, with EBITDA and ROCE margin exceeding the 25% levels.\n\nThis impressive performance was reflected in our cash flow, and we continue to have a strong\n\nbalance sheet. We progressed well on our strategic priorities and were able to invest in our\n\norganic capabilities and business development opportunities to thrive and deliver on our purpose\n\nover the long term.\n\nLet me take you through some of the key highlights of the year.\n\n1. We witnessed underlying growth momentum in FY23 across all businesses, adjusted for\n\nCOVID products' contribution during last year.\n\n2.\n\nRevenue in North America Generics and in Branded markets of India and EM crossed the\n\n$1 billion mark for the second consecutive year.\n\n3.\n\nWe divested certain non-core brands in India to focus on strengthening the core.\n\n4.\n\nOur EBITDA is at 30%, and our ROCE is at 35%.\n\n5.\n\nWe generated a strong free cash flow, leading to a net cash surplus of $614 million.\n\n6.\n\nWe also see positive momentum on BD/M&As with acquisition of Novartis Cardiovascular\n\nbrand in India, Mayne Pharma's U.S. generic prescription product portfolio, and Eton's\n\nbranded and generic injectable products in the United States.\n\nPage 4 of 17\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nSignificant progress also made in our biosimilar businesses. We see a launch of biosimilar Stimufend which is Pegfilgrastim by Fresenius KABI in the U.S. We completed and we saw the completion of clinical studies of Rituximab biosimilars, and we already filed in U.S., Europe, and the UK MHRA. We saw the completions of phase one study of biosimilar tocilizumab, and global phase three study was initiated. Recently we received approvals for three products in China, namely Sevelamer, Sitagliptin, and Carboprost, and our partners got GEA approval for Nicergoline tablets. We are also progressing well in our digitalization, as well as our ESG journey. Our diversified global presence, capability, and strong balance sheet make us a partner of choice. We continue to work towards strengthening our position as a partner of choice, including in horizon two spaces. From a horizon two perspective, we signed some strategic licensing deals in April 23, including the below With Cardiacare for their wearable for atrial fibrillation treatment With Theranica for the wearable in management of migraine With the New Zealand based WZTL to bring the third generation CAR T asset for clinical trials in India With Junshi Bioscience to bring Toripalimab to India and other markets.\n\nWe are investing in development and trials of these DTX, CAR T, biosimilar assets in keeping with our stated horizon two strategy. We see them as a future growth drivers.\n\nNow let me take you through the key business highlights for the Q4 and FY23. Please note that all the reference to the numbers in this section are in respective local currencies. Our North America generic business recorded sales of $312 million for the quarter, with a strong growth of 18% year over year and 17% decline on sequential basis.\n\nOn a full year basis, we recorded sales of $1,268 million, with a growth of 26% over the previous year. This growth was largely led by new product launches such as Lenalidomide, Sorafenib tablets and Timolol gel, and growing market share in certain key existing products, which more than offset increased price erosion. We launched 6 products during the quarter and overall 25 products during the year. We expect the launch momentum to further improve in FY24.\n\nOur Europe business recorded sales of Euro 56 million this quarter, with year over year growth of 7% and sequential quarter growth of 9%. On a full year basis, the sales are Euro 210 million and has grown by 9%, driven by base business volume and new product launches. We launched 5 new products during the quarter and 35 for the full year in Europe across all markets. We expect this launch momentum to continue in FY 24.\n\nOur Emerging Market business recorded sales of Rs 1,114 crores, with year over year decline of 7% and sequential quarter decline of 15%. On a full year basis, Emerging Market sales have been roughly flat at Rs 4,553 crores. However, the sales have grown by 13%, adjusted for the COVID-related products and divestment income in FY22. We launched 10 new products during the quarter and 94 new products during the year across various countries of the Emerging Markets. Within the EM segments, the Russia business in Q4 declined by 34% on a year to year basis and 17% on a QoQ basis in constant currency. In FY23, Russia business declined by 9% in constant currency. The decline is attributable to divestment of few non-core brands during the\n\nPage 5 of 17\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal Link Original Document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited published this content on 15 May 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

            "title": "Great Pharma Firm Dr Reddy's Laboratories Becomes Nifty 50's Top Loser.",
            "body": "Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd's stock was the worst performer in the Nifty 50 recently, falling roughly 7% in response to the announcement of poor March quarter (Q4 FY23) earnings. Its revenue fell owing to reduced sales from gRevlimid and the US generics portfolio, resulting in a 530 bps sequential decline in its projected Ebitda margin to 25.1% for the March quarter.\n\nSome experts believed that early prices accounted for most of the benefits for Dr Reddy's. Before the presentation of the Q4 results, Dr Reddy's stock had risen 15% so far this calendar year. Adjusting for numerous divestments, the core Ebitda margins came in at around 21.9%, according to Antique Stock Broking analysts. It should be noted that Dr Reddy's introduced gRevlimid in the United States in Q2FY23, with a 180-day sales exclusivity for the 2.5 mg and 20 mg dosages. Lower revenues in the fourth quarter weighed on profits in the previous quarter.\n\nIn the US market, generic gRevlimid sales have been the most important contributors to revenue for Dr Reddy's. However, this category suffered a setback in the current quarter, falling by half to 17% compared to Q3 and Q2 sales. The EBITDA margin was 21.7% in the March 2023 quarter, down around 8% from the previous quarter. This demonstrates the abnormally large influence of gRevlimid. According to industry pundits, the dimming of gRevlimid's disproportionately large contribution owing to decreasing demand in the future spells pain for the corporation.\n\nThe road ahead is difficult for Dr Reddy's, with profit growth projected to slow in FY24 following a robust performance in FY23. Analysts are concerned that Dr Reddy's earnings will be dragged down by the high base of FY23 and the lack of visibility of possible products over the next two years.\n\nIn fiscal year 23, it introduced 25 new goods in the United States. It has a healthy pipeline of 81 abbreviated new drug applications or ANDAs. While gRevlimid represents a huge opportunity, sales may fluctuate once the exclusive period expires. Furthermore, without gRevlimid, substantial growth might be difficult.\n\nIn the future, the business wants to commercialise 25-30 molecules in the fiscal year 2024, including peptides and gPentasa, gCopaxone, and gVenofer. It plans to increase its presence in gAmitiza, gNuvaring, gRemodulin, and gLexiscan. Furthermore, with China's supply limits and the world embracing the 'China plus one policy, Dr Reddy is poised to gain from this long-term megatrend.\n\nJM Financial Institutional Securities Analysts predict the Mayne Pharma deal to be earnings accretive in FY24. The brokerage has accounted for the purchase in its projections. Dr Reddy's wants to be one of India's top five pharmaceutical corporations. Its domestic company may outperform industry growth as it follows inorganic expansion on the strength of robust cash flows. Price erosion, on the other pointer, remains a problem. In India, competition is fierce, with everyone vying for a piece of the chronic market. According to Unnati Jadhav, research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, it may eventually lower Dr Reddy's market share.\n\nThe company's management anticipates dual-digit growth in all important markets in FY24. As a result, all focus will be on new product releases that generate money, sell existing commodities, and maintain quality at its facilities.\n\nHowever, margin performance may be tracked. The firm believes that the competitive intensity in the US business remains high. The lack of niche-limited competition products is likely to cap its core Ebitda margins at 22-23%. Furthermore, government efforts like the product-linked incentive (PLI) plan and the creation of bulk medication parks benefit Indian pharma enterprises.\n\nWe will have to wait and watch how the stocks perform in the markets going forward.\n\nProofread, Edited & Published By Naveenika Chauhan",

However, it posted lower-than-expected EBITDA/PAT due to higher opex. DRRD delivered the highest-ever annual earnings in FY23, led by strong traction in g-Revlimid.\n\nOutlook\n\nWe reduce our earnings estimates for FY24/FY25 by 7%/7.5%, factoring in 1) higher SGA expenses, 2) prolonged slowdown in the CIS business, and 3) some price erosion in export markets.

They like the visibility of ramp-up in sales in China, Europe and other emerging markets, as well as value-accretive M&A. Dr. Reddy's expects its India business -- a bright spot in 4Q -- to grow further, and guides for double-digit growth in most EMs like China, where it makes up to 20 product filings a year.

MSCI decided to offload two of Adani Group stocks as well.\n\nApart from Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, MSCI reduced the weights of Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, and Mphasis, according to The Economic Times report. The weights of Reliance Industries, Bajaj Finance, Hindalco Industries, Bharat Petroleum Corp, JSW Steel, Divi's Laboratories, ICICI Bank, HDFC Ltd, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Hindustan Unilever, Shree Cement, and Axis Bank were also cut.\n\nMSCI reduced Infosys' weight by 22 basis points which will result in net outflows of $134 million. RIL's weight has been reduced by 26 basis points, which will see net outflows of about $155 million, BPCL's weight has been cut by just 6 bps, which may trigger outflows of about $38 million.\n\nThe exit of Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas from the MSCI Global will result in an outflow of $201million and $186 million. While the cut in weights of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and HDFC will lead to cumulative outflows of a little over $200 million, as per the Nuvama Alternative Quantitative Research estimates. The resultant total net outflow will likely be around $1 billion.\n\nHowever to replace the 15 stocks whose weights were reduced, MSCI increased the weightage of eight index stocks namely, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, and Power Grid Corp of India.\n\nKotak Bank was increased by 135 bps in terms of the weightage, which alone will bring net inflows of over $800 million.The increase in the weight of other index stocks will result in net inflows of around $400 million.\n\nApart from the index stocks, Zomato, YES Bank, Samvardhana Motherson, and TVS Motor also saw an increase in their weights. Zomato's weight has been increased by 10 bps, which may see FII inflows of around $60 million.\n\nMORE MSCI NEWS Top Adani Energy Stocks To Buy With Bearish Market, Given Upto 168% Soaring Return In 1 Year MSCI Rejig: 7 Stocks Including Tata Power To Find Place In Sensex, Zomato To Be A Large-Cap Stock MSCI World Index: HDFC MF Launches First International Fund MSCI Semi-Annual Index Review: Adds 6 Stocks To India Index, 33 To Small Cap Index-Complete List Adani's 3 Companies May Be Included In MSCI India Index In May Bharti Airtel Up 5% On Possible Weightage Increase In MSCI Index MSCI Global Standard Index Rejig Effective Today 2 Indian Stocks Removed From MSCI Index In Semi-Annual Review, 12 Stocks Added MSCI to Tweak FOL In Indian Stocks; Huge Foreign Funds Expected Muthoot Finance Shares May Be Included In MSCI India Index After 70% Jump This Year MSCI India Index Revision Becomes Effective; 8 Stocks Added Why Do Changes In MSCI Index Matter To Indian Stocks?

            "body": "GSK (NYSE:GSK) said it welcomed a Canadian court's decision to dismiss a proposed class action suit on behalf of a class of ranitidine users in Canada.\n\nThe British pharma giant said that the decision recognizes that after more than three years of study, the scientific consensus is that there is no reliable evidence that ranitidine increases the risk for any type of cancer.\n\nThe company added that since 2019 there have been 13 peer-reviewed epidemiological studies conducted looking at human data related to the use of ranitidine, sold as Zantac for heartburn.\n\n\"Given the uncontroverted evidence that neither ranitidine nor NDMA are reliably associated with increased cancer risk, and the absence of evidence that ranitidine or NDMA cause cancer in humans, the plaintiff has failed to raise a bona fide triable issue regarding injury due to the ingestion and/or purchase of ranitidine,\" said the British Columbia Supreme Court in Dussiaume v. Sandoz Canada Inc. 2023 BCSC 795, according to the company.\n\nGSK noted that it will continue to defend proposed class actions by ranitidine users which have been filed in Ontario and Quebec and individual actions by users of the drug in Canada.\n\nZantac (ranitidine) was pulled from the U.S. market in 2020 amid concerns over the unacceptable levels of potential human carcinogen, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA).\n\nZantac lawsuits have been a cause of concern for not only GSK, but also Sanofi (SNY), GSK consumer spinoff Haleon (HLN), Pfizer (PFE), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Perrigo (PRGO), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY), and Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nThe companies have faced thousands of lawsuits for alleged failure to adequately warn health risks of the antacid. A report from Bloomberg Businessweek in February, claimed that GSK chose to keep quiet on the cancer risks of Zantac.\n\nIn March, GSK said it disagreed with a California state court ruling in respect to the Goetz case related to Zantac. In December 2022, Sanofi and Pfizer had reached an agreement in a Zantac case in California that was set to go to trial, while GSK remained a defendant in the case.\n\nAlso last year, a federal judge in Florida ruled that GSK and Sanofi would not have to face thousands of lawsuits related to claims that Zantac allegedly cause cancer. GSK had noted that the court dismissed all Multi-District Litigation (MDL) cases alleging the five remaining cancers in the MDL.",

Technically, Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President of Technical Research at Kotak Securities, suggests that Ratnamani Metals could experience pricing issues below 2325, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has weak momentum, and FSL could encounter profit booking.Indian market pared gains and closed negative on Thursday. The S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty50 closet flat with a negative bias.\n\nSectorally, selling was seen in capital goods, metals, healthcare, and energy stocks while some buying was visible in power, utilities, consumer durables, and FMCG stocks.\n\nStocks that were in focus include names like Ratnamani Metals which rose more than 6%, Dr Reddy's Laboratories which fell nearly 7% and Firstsource Solutions which closed near its 52-week high on Thursday.\n\nHere's what Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President - Technical Research, Kotak Securities Ltd recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:\n\nRatnamani Metal: Below 2325 uptrend would be vulnerable\n\nThe stock has rallied over 20% so far in this quarter. Last Thursday, it opened on a gap-up note and registered a fresh all-time high of 2528.\n\nHowever, due to profit booking at higher levels, it trimmed some intraday gains. We are of the view that the short-term texture of the stock is bullish but mildly overbought.\n\nHence, we could expect rangebound activity in the near term. Technically, 2350-2325 would be the immediate support level while on the upside, 2525 -2550 could be the immediate hurdle for the bulls.\n\nOn the flip side, below 2325, the uptrend would be vulnerable.\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories: Weak momentum is likely to continue\n\nAfter a promising uptrend rally, the stock corrected sharply. This week, it has corrected by over 8%. A sharp reversal formation and long bearish candle on weekly charts indicate further weakness from the current levels.\n\nTechnically, as long as the stock is trading below the 50-Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 4650, weak momentum is likely to continue.\n\nBelow the same, the stock could slip towards Rs 4500-4425. On the other side, a minor pullback rally is possible if the stock succeeds to trade above 4570.\n\nA close above the same could move the stock higher towards Rs 4600-4620.\n\nFSL: Profit booking at higher levels\n\nThe stock has rallied nearly 25% so far in this quarter. After reversal formation, the stock successfully cleared the medium-term resistance of 125, and post the breakout, it intensified the positive momentum.\n\nOn the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation formation. We are of the view that the short-term texture of the market is bullish but due to temporarily overbought conditions we could see some profit booking at higher levels.\n\nFor trend-following traders, buying on dips and selling on rallies would be the ideal strategy. Technically, 127-125 would be the key support zones while 137-143 could be the immediate profit booking area for the bulls.\n\nOn the flip side, below 125, traders may prefer to exit from the trading long positions\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The adjusted EBITDA margin on the other hand, without divestment income, is closer to around 22 per cent, missing the consensus expectation of a 25 per cent EBITDA margin.

This could be tied to volume-limited launch contracts for gRevlimid or channel destocking. Management expects stable contribution from the product in FY24.\n\nThe quarter also witnessed 16 launches in the US, and the company reported 25 launches in the year. Dr Reddy expects to sustain a similar launch momentum in FY24 as well, with stable contribution from gRevlimid driving strong growth in US markets. But the investor focus may be centred on dip in sales post FY26 when gRevlimid opportunity may sharply decline and margin performance following the dip.\n\nAlso read: Dr Reddy's launches generic Treprostinil injection\n\nIndia and pipeline\n\nIndia accounts for 20 per cent of Q4FY23 revenues with US/Emerging markets/Europe accounting for 40/18/8 per cent of revenues. Dr. Reddy has been divesting non-core brands in India and in-licensing brands to restructure its India portfolio, which it considers its key market. India, excluding divestment income and Covid sales, reported 11 per cent growth YoY in the quarter. Apart from in-licensing to complement its domestic portfolio, the company plans to increase its footprint, which should gain from the focussed portfolio.\n\nThe international biosimilar portfolio is progressing as per Dr Reddy's quarterly update. Pegfilgrastim launch by Dr Reddy's commercial partner, Fresenius Kabi, in developed markets, filing for Rituximab in the US, Europe, and the UK and global phase-III trials for tocilizumab are in progress. The company has also in-licensed or got into a strategic partnership with others, including medical devices and CAR-T assets for trials in India in the long run.\n\nAlso read: About 25% of Dr Reddy's products to be first-to-market by 2027: Co-chairman GV Prasad\n\nValuation\n\nPost the 7 per cent dip, Dr. Reddy is trading at 18 times one year forward earnings . The valuation takes into account contribution from gRevlimid earnings in FY24 which are largely one time lumpsum gains. With the strong cash flows from US portfolio, focussed India portfolio, a start from Biosimilar revenue stream in developed markets and commercialisation of current pipeline in development, Dr. Reddy should sustain earnings even beyond gRevlimid earnings cliff in FY26. The cost of development will be reflected in muted margin growth in the meanwhile, despite strong product mix. We reiterate our accumulate rating on Dr. Reddy stock considering the strong product mix and product development underway. .\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 12, 2023",

The stock made an intraday low of ₹4,524.05 apiece in Thursday's trading before closing at ₹4,532, down 6.9%.\n\n\"Revlimid sales drop leads to miss on estimates,\" said Jefferies in a client note. \"The US sales could remain volatile but the new product launch momentum remains strong across geographies.\"\n\nThe US brokerage sees a 23% upside potential from current levels and remains the most optimistic on the stock even after lowering FY24 EPS by 5% owing to lower margins.\n\nOn Thursday, Dr Reddy's reported an 890% year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit for the fourth quarter at ₹960.1 crore, while revenue (from operations) grew 15.28% to ₹5,843 crore.\n\nJP Morgan sees the likelihood of a 17% downside with the brokerage too cutting its price target. Brokerage Nuvama downgraded the stock with a revised target price that translates into a potential 8% decline from current levels.\n\nOf the 23 analysts who reviewed Dr Reddy's fourth-quarter earnings, eight have a 'buy' or 'outperform' rating and 13 had 'hold' or 'reduce'.",

            "title": "After a weak quarter, Dr Reddy's stares at a gradual recovery",
            "body": "Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd's stock emerged as the top loser among the Nifty 50 companies on Thursday, dropping nearly 7% following the release of disappointing March quarter (Q4 FY23) earnings. Its revenue took a hit due to lower sales from gRevlimid and the US generics portfolio, which resulted in a sequential decline of 530 basis point in its calculated Ebitda margin to 25.1% for the March quarter.\n\nSome analysts reckoned that the valuations were factoring in most of the positives initially. So far this calendar year, the stock gained 15% before its Q4 result announcement.\"Adjusting for various divestments, the core Ebitda margins as per our estimates came in at about 21.9%,\" said Antique Stock Broking analysts. Note, the company had launched gRevlimid in US in Q2FY23 with sales exclusivity of 180 days for 2.5 mg and 20 mg strengths. Its lower sales in Q4 weighed on the last quarter's profitability.\n\nThe path ahead seems tough with profit growth expected to moderate in FY24 after a strong performance in FY23. Analysts worry that the high base of FY23 and limited visibility of potential products over the next two years may drag Dr Reddy's earnings.\n\nIn FY23, it launched 25 new products in the US. Further, it has a robust pipeline of 81 abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs. While gRevlimid offers significant opportunity, its sales may fluctuate as the exclusivity period is over. Moreover, substantial growth, excluding gRevlimid, could be challenging.\n\nAmong positives, JM Financial Institutional Securities' analysts expect the Mayne Pharma acquisition to be earning accretive in FY24 itself. The brokerage has factored the acquisition into their estimates. Dr Reddy's aspires to be one of the top five pharma companies in India. Its domestic business may beat industry growth, as it explores inorganic growth on the back of strong cash -flows. However, price erosion remains a concern. \"Competition is high in India with everyone wanting a share of the chronic segment. It may eventually reduce market share for Dr Reddy's,\" Unnati Jadhav, research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said.\n\nThe company's management expects all key markets to grow in double digits in FY24. Thus, all eyes will be on new launches, which can fetch revenues, sales of existing products and maintaining quality at its facilities.\n\nMargin performance is monitorable, though. \"We continue to believe the competitive intensity remains high in the US business and lack of niche limited competition products is likely to cap its core Ebitda margins at 22-23%,\" said Antique's analysts.",

Key resistance levels are expected to be 43,694 along with 43,790 and 43,946.\n\nCall options data\n\nOn the weekly options front, we have seen the maximum Call open interest (OI) at 18,300 strike, with 1.34 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty in the coming sessions.\n\nThis was followed by 18,400 strike, comprising 87.75 lakh contracts, and 18,500 strike, with more than 83.99 lakh contracts.\n\nCall writing was seen at 18,300 strike, which added 59.23 lakh contracts.\n\nCall unwinding was at 18,500 strike, which shed 34.29 lakh contracts, followed by 18,200 strike, which shed 29.06 lakh contracts, and 18,600 strike, which shed 21.84 lakh contracts.\n\nThe maximum Put open interest was at 18,200 strike with 72.72 lakh contracts, which is expected to act as an important support level in the coming sessions.\n\nThis was followed by the 18,300 strike, comprising 60.62 lakh contracts, and the 18,100 strike where we have 52.88 lakh contracts.\n\nPut writing was seen at 17,300 strike, which added 4.76 lakh contracts, followed by 17,400 strike, which added 2.31 lakh contracts.\n\nWe have seen Put unwinding at 18,200 strike, which shed 42.89 lakh contracts, followed by 18,100 strike, which shed 32.13 lakh contracts, and 18,000 strike, which shed 31.11 lakh contracts.\n\nA high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Atul, Bajaj Auto, Titan Company, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, among others.\n\nAn increase in open interest (OI) and price typically indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 63 stocks, including Siemens, Delta Corp, Gujarat Gas, ACC, and Adani Enterprises saw long build-ups.\n\nA decline in OI and price generally indicates a long unwinding. Based on the OI percentage, 19 stocks including Mahanagar Gas, Aurobindo Pharma, Laurus Labs, Alkem Laboratories, and Canara Bank saw a long unwinding.\n\nAn increase in OI along with a price decrease indicates a build-up of short positions.

            "body": "Indian shares closed lower on Thursday due to weak quarterly earnings reports, despite positive inflation data from the US. The Nifty 50 index fell 0.10% to 18,297, while the S&P BSE Sensex decreased 0.06% to 61,904.52. The upswing in the market has been influenced by consistent FII inflows and the weakness of the US dollar. The weak earnings data from heavyweight companies dampened investor sentiment.Indian shares reversed intraday gains and logged losses on Thursday, as a handful of downbeat quarterly earnings reports overshadowed optimism from favourable U.S. inflation data.The Nifty 50 closed 0.10% lower at 18,297, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.06% to 61,904.52.\n\n\"The current market rally has been largely influenced by consistent FII inflows, driven by lower treasury yields and the weakness of the US Dollar. However, the gains in the domestic market were tempered by weak earnings reported by a few heavyweight companies. On the global front, markets remained positive as US inflation eased below 5%, providing reassurance to investors that the Fed's rate hike measures have been effective in managing inflation levels,\" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.\"The short-term uptrend formation is still positive, and the index is consistently forming a higher bottom formation which is also supportive for bulls. We are of the view that as long as the index is trading above 18200, the uptrend formation Is likely to continue. Above this, the index could move up till 18400-18475. On the flip side, below 18200, the market could slip till 18125-18100,\" Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities, said.\n\nThat said, here's a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday's action:\n\nWall Street Watch\n\nWall Street is slipping Thursday, weighed down by a sharp drop for The Walt Disney Co. and flaring fears about the health of some U.S. banks.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.3% lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 287 points, or 0.8%, at 33,243, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was virtually unchanged.\n\nEuropean Shares\n\nEurope's stock markets, the dollar and oil all had a spring back in their step on Thursday as a deflationary jolt from China made way for broader optimism ahead of what was set to be the Bank of England's 12th straight rate rise later.\n\nHopes that the U.S. The Federal Reserve's aggressive hiking cycle may be over at least it was still feeding through following inflation data there on Wednesday, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.5% and key borrowing costs inching down.\n\nTech View: Small negative candle\n\nA small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadows. Technically, this pattern indicates a formation of high wave type candle formation, but not a classical one.\n\nStocks showing bullish bias\n\nMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of Zee Entertainment, GCPL, Quess Corp, HG Infra and Sanofi India, among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with highest trading turnovers in the day.\n\nMost active stocks in volume terms\n\nVodafone Idea (Shares traded: 20.25 crore), IRFC (Shares traded: 13.77 crore), Zomato (Shares traded: 7.5 crore), RVNL (Shares traded: 5.14 crore), and YES Bank (Shares traded: 4.9 crore) among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.\n\nStocks showing buying interest\n\nShares of Ratnamani Metals Cyient, KEI Industries, HG Infra, Siemens and Glenmark Pharma, among others, witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.\n\nStocks seeing selling pressure\n\nShares of Vikas Multicorp, Paisalo Digital and BEML Land Assets, among others, hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.\n\nSentiment meter favours bulls\n\nOverall, market breadth favoured bulls as 1,942 stocks ended in the green, while 1,553 names settled with losses.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "body": "New York, May 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Several cutting-edge cancer treatments available all over the world and a rising need for innovation in cancer treatments led the global non-muscle invasive bladder cancer therapeutics market to reach a value of US$ 2.2 billion in 2022, and the market is projected to expand rapidly at a CAGR of 14.8% over the forecast period (2023 to 2033).

The drugmaker's net profit for the quarter jumped 10-fold to Rs 959.2 crore from Rs 87.5 crore in the same period last year but still lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 1,093.6 crore.\n\nIts revenue from operations stood at Rs 5,843 crore in Q4 FY23, up 15.28% YoY as against Rs 5,068.4 crore in Q4 FY22. Meanwhile, total expenses were down 4 per cent at Rs 5,132.2 crore against Rs 5,348.4 crore in Q4FY22.\n\nRevenue came in at Rs 6,296.8 crore, 15.81 per cent up from Rs 5,436.8 crore in the year-ago quarter. The topline beat the Street's expectation of Rs 6,090.5 crore for the quarter under review.\n\nEBIDTA margin also expanded to 25.9 percent in January-March from 23.9 per cent in the same quarter last year.\n\n\"Dr Reddys' reported an all round miss vs our expectation as US revenues declined 17% QoQ and margin stood at 25 per cent. Management commentary reaffirmed growth in US business though we sense it may be difficult to grow on a Revlimid base in FY25 and beyond,\" YES Securities said.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do Now?\n\nBrokerages, however, don't seem too impressed with the numbers as subdued performance of the core business and waning of gRevlimid's disproportionately high contribution points towards pain.\n\nEven though the management expects gRevlimid to continue contributing to its revenue in the coming quarters, brokerages do not share the optimism.\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities, said that given the contribution from gRevlimid was cut in half, Q4FY23 was a stronger reflection of the company's main business than Q2/Q3. The pipeline for the company is strong, but the brokerage points out difficulties with important items like gCiprodex, where market share has dropped by roughly 1200 bp, and gVascepa, gKuvan, and gNuvaring, which have plateaued.\n\nIt predicted single digit organic growth despite successful launches like gRemodulin and gLexsican, at roughly USD950mn ex gRevlimid base.\n\nThe brokerage has downgraded the stock to 'Reduce' despite gRevlimid strength.\n\n\"We keep FY24/25E consolidated EPS unchanged, but cut core EPS (ex- gRevlimid) by about 12% given core business challenges. Our 300bp Q4FY23-FY25 core margin expansion captures upside potential. Our ₹4,200 target price (vs ₹4,675) is based on unchanged 22x FY25E EPS and ₹435 from gRevlimid; downgrade to 'REDUCE/SU',\" said the brokerage in its report.\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher downgraded Dr Reddy's to Reduce from Buy with a revised target price of Rs 4,500 from Rs 4,900.\n\n\"Dr Reddy's Q4FY23 reported profitability was in line with our estimate. Adjusted for one-time divestment income (Rs 2.65 billion), EBITDA was 20% below our estimates impacted by lower GMs and higher overheads. Our FY24E and FY25E EPS stands reduced by 10% and 6% as we factor in lower margins ex of gRevlimid,\" it said.\n\nYES Securities downgraded Dr Reddy's to Neutral with a target price of Rs 5,150.\n\n\"Dr Reddys' reported an all round miss vs our expectation as US revenues declined 17% QoQ and margin stood at 25%.

However, the stock has surged over 17% in the last one year.\n\nShould you buy, sell or hold Dr Reddy's stock? Here's what analysts say:\n\nJefferies | Buy\n\nJefferies maintained its Buy rating on Dr Reddy's Laboratories with a target price of Rs 5,650. Revlimid sales drop leads to miss on estimates.\n\nThe US sales could remain volatile but the new product launch momentum remains strong across geographies. The global investment bank lowered FY24 EPS by 5% on lower margins.\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher downgraded Dr Reddy's to Reduce from Buy with a revised target price of Rs 4,500 from Rs 4,900.\n\n\"Dr Reddy's Q4FY23 reported profitability was in line with our estimate. Adjusted for one-time divestment income (Rs 2.65 billion), EBITDA was 20% below our estimates impacted by lower GMs and higher overheads. Our FY24E and FY25E EPS stands reduced by 10% and 6% as we factor in lower margins ex of gRevlimid,\" it said.\n\nJM Financial\n\nJM Financial maintained its Buy rating on Dr Reddys with a target price of Rs 5,980.\n\n\"DRRD's 4Q earnings were below our estimates on account of lower gRevlimid sales which reflected in EBITDA and PAT misses. We have factored in Mayne Pharma acquisition into our estimates and expect it to be earnings accretive in FY24 itself. The US base business ex-Revlimid is around USD 250mn, in our view, which should see some improvement from upcoming launches (25-30 in FY24),\" it said.\n\nYES Securities\n\nYES Securities downgraded Dr Reddy's to Neutral with a target price of Rs 5,150.\n\n\"Dr Reddys' reported an all round miss vs our expectation as US revenues declined 17% QoQ and margin stood at 25%.

These reports offer BQ Prime's subscribers an opportunity to expand their understanding of companies, sectors and the economy.\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.'s core business performance in Q4 FY23 seems to be on the lower side - excluding assumed business from gRevlimid sales of $65 million-70 million. Ebitda margin would have been ~20%, which in our view, shows deterioration over the previous years.\n\nFurthermore, we exclude the Eris Lifesciences Ltd. brand sale (~Rs 250 crore) from the India business. Ebitda margins have further deteriorated as compared to the previous quarters. The Eris reports ~32% Ebitda margins for its business.\n\nU.S. at ~$310 million would have included ~$65-70 million of gRevlimid. We believe Ciprodex's market share loss and stagnation in other key products could have led to a modest Q4 revenue and margins.\n\nThe reported gross margin was 69.9% and the Ebitda margin was ~25.1%. However, excluding gRevlimid and Eris brand sales, Dr. Reddy's gross margins stood at 65% and Ebitda margin at 20%.\n\nOutlook:\n\nQ4FY22 results were week. However, we believe the company's strategy of investing in various businesses may provide growth in the long term. Dr. Reddy's is proactively building a global pipeline of biosimilars, developing new chemical entity for immunooncology, and building up a Neutraceuticals portfolio, vaccines, contract development and manufacturing organisation, and digital healthcare platforms.\n\nDr. Reddy's is planning to launch at least 30 products in the U.S. in FY24E. There are complex drugs in the pipeline that could drive revenue growth over the next four-five years as per the management.",

            "body": "Shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories plunged 7 per cent to Rs 4,545 on the BSE in Thursday's intra-day after the company delivered an operating miss in January-March quarter (Q4FY23) due to lower sales across markets, barring Europe, as well as higher marketing and R&D costs. In Q4FY23, the company's revenue grew 18 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and was down 8 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) at Rs 5,430 crore. The company said QoQ decline in revenue was mainly due to decline in North America and Emerging Markets, partially offset by growth in Europe and India. In Q4, the company's North America's revenue declined 17 per cent QoQ to Rs 2,530 crore, due to fluctuations in demand for new launches. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins grew 1,605 bps YoY to 24.3 per cent. However, adjusted for non-core brands sales, the margins were at 21 per cent. Adjusted profit after tax increased 192.6 per cent YoY to Rs 952.5 crore. US business grew 26.8 per cent YoY to Rs 2,532 crore, driven by new products launches and favourable forex movement, which was partly offset by price erosion. While US growth was far ahead of estimates, adjusted India growth was in line. Europe revenues were also higher than estimates. Pharmaceutical services and active Ingredients witnessed growth due to favourable currency movements but were below estimates. Quarterly fluctuations notwithstanding, the company continue to deliver within its determined framework, ICICI Securities said in its note. The brokerage firm remains positive on the company's growth story based on simultaneous launches across major geographies and persistent recalibration of the existing portfolio. Dr Reddy's reported sales in line with our estimates, with a 5 per cent miss on our's EBITDA estimates due to higher SG&A (up 15 per cent YoY) and R&D (up 24 per cent YoY) costs, analysts at Kotak Securities said. The miss would have been higher at 21 per cent as the company not reported income of Rs 264 crore from the divestment of a few brands in India to Eris, the brokerage firm added. The company has maintained its 25 per cent medium-term EBITDA margin guidance, but the company's quarterly core margins have fluctuated widely in the 17-23 per cent range in the past two years. Going forward, apart from the peptides, we build in key launches, including gPentasa, gCopaxone and gVenofer as well as factor in sales rampup in gAmitiza, gNuvaring, gRemodulin and gLexiscan, into our estimates. However, on an elevated US base, given the slow pace of complex launches, we remain concerned about DRRD's ex-gRevlimid US growth outlook, analysts said. Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher downgrade stock to Reduce from Buy with revised target price of Rs 4,500/share (Rs 4,900 earlier). At CMP, DR Redy is trading at expensive valuations of 24x P/E on FY25E adjusted for gRevlimid. Any big ticket ANDA approvals and sharp recovery in base business margins are key risks to our call, the brokerage firm said.",

Broader markets were also trading in positive territory in the wake of positive global sentiments.\n\nSome of the top sectoral indices were Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services, Nifty IT and Nifty Oil and Gas. Nifty Pharma was down almost 1 per cent.\n\nThe top gainers on the Nifty 50 were Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, NTPC, HDFC Life and Tech Mahindra.\n\nAdani Enterprises and Adani Ports were the top two gainers on the index, following a report that indicated that the conglomerate's flagship firm is considering a stock sale.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Reddy's Laboratories was the biggest drag on the index, losing over 5 per cent in early trade. L&T also lost nearly 5 per cent, while Hindalco was down over 3 per cent. Bharti Airtel and ITC also lost nearly 1 per cent each.\n\nWhile domestic markets seem to be on a winning streak, volatility seems to be on the rise on Dalal Street as investors are now awaiting India's April inflation data, due on May 12.\n\nThe mood, however, remains fairly positive in the wake of strong Q4 results, improvement in US consumer inflation prices, and strong foreign buying in domestic equities.",

These reports offer BQ Prime's subscribers an opportunity to expand their understanding of companies, sectors and the economy.\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.'s Q4 FY23 revenue was in-line with our/consensus expectations. We had anticipated a QoQ decline in revenue led by slowdown in gRevlimid sales in the U.S. Net earnings at Rs 9,592 million were 4.8%/6.4% below our/consensus estimates as there was steep increase in research and development costs and one off impairment charge.\n\nThe production linked incentive incentive contribution was also weak during the quarter. One off gain from brand divestments in the Indian market helped offset these pressures.\n\nDr. Reddy's has been aggressively filing products in the Chinese market; the company has received approval for three products and expects incremental revenue contribution to start in FY24.\n\nDr. Reddy's North America business declined by ~17% QoQ due to lower gRevlimid sales in the U.S. due to fluctuating volume share in this market. While we expect Dr. Reddy's to be permitted a higher volume share in gRevlimid in FY24, price erosion in the market will need to be monitored given multiple generic entrants in FY24.\n\nDr. Reddy's has maintained its Ebitda margin guidance of ~25% for the next two years. The company is also aiming to grow in double digits across business segments.",

Its Ebitda went up 25.9 per cent to Rs. 1,631 crore while its gross margin was at 57.2 per cent in Q4 FY23.\n\nThe company incurred Rs 537 crore in research and development.\n\nCommenting on the results, Co-Chairman and Managing Director, G V Prasad said: \"FY23 has been a year of record sales, profits and cash flow, driven by our performance in US Generics. We progressed well in our productivity and sustainability agenda. We will continue to deliver on our purpose, invest in growth drivers and promote a culture that is innovative and collaborative ensuring the future of our business.\"\n\nIn FY23, the firm's net profit went up 91 per cent to Rs 4,507 crore in the quarter under review over the figure in the year-ago period.

The growth was also aided by the divestment of a few non-core brands during the year.\n\n\"During the year, we launched nine brands in India,\" the company said. (ANI)",

            "title": "Dr. Reddy's: A Profitable, Predictable Margin Expander",
            "body": "The Profitable Predictable Margin Expanders screener on GuruFocus has been a helpful one for me when searching for quality stocks that show solid growth. It does what the name suggests - it sorts through the thousands of stocks in the GuruFocus database and selects those that are currently profitable, have a business predictability ranking of at least 3 out of 5 stars and have expanding operating margins. There are no criteria for valuation or other considerations.\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd (NYSE:RDY) is one of only 42 stocks that make it through the screener. While it may not be undervalued, it is at least fairly valued according to the GF Value chart.\n\nAbout Dr. Reddys\n\nDr. Reddy's develops and manufactures pharmaceutical products and specializes in low-cost, easy-to-produce generic drugs and pharmaceutical ingredients. This illustration of its income statement shows where it gets its revenues and what becomes of them:\n\nBased in Hyderabad, India and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, it sells its products globally. It has a market cap of $10.18 billion and had trailing 12-month revenue of just under $3 billion.\n\nNote that it has industry-leading results for the drug manufacturers industry in all but one category. Most importantly for the screener, it enjoys a higher operating margin than 89.50% of peers.\n\nIt's worth noting, too, that its return on equity is among the best in the industry at 18.04%, which means it should double in value over four years by my estimates.\n\nGrowth\n\nWhile there are lots of dark green bars on the profitability table, the picture doesnt look as positive for its growth based on the earnings per share without non-recurring items. As this 10-year chart shows, there have been only three \"up\" years in the past decade.\n\nTurning to predictability, Dr. Reddys scores 3 out of 5 on its GuruFocus business predictability rank, which meets the screener's minimum. Behind the predictability rank is the ability to consistently generate increased revenues and Ebitda, while keeping costs in line.\n\nTo grow its revenue relatively consistently, a company must have a tried and tested marketing strategy and new products that not only maintain current sales levels but also expand its market each year.\n\nIn addition, it also must keep its fixed and variable costs under control. That can be particularly difficult when inflation rises, but Dr. Reddys has a continuous improvement initiative.\n\nMargins\n\nGrowing margins are the third major criterion for the screener. In this case, expansion means growth of net margin (a minimum of 10% per year) and the operating margin (a minimum of 5% per year).\n\nHeres a chart showing the operating margin in green and the operating margin in red:\n\nRDY Data by GuruFocus\n\nObviously, there has been some improvement over the past five years, but over the past 10 years there has been a decline in these two margins.\n\nNormally, I would take that as bad news, but we have to consider that both margins are still industry-leading, so perhaps they can be seen as normalizing rather than being in trouble.\n\nTaking a closer look, I see that the industrys operating margin median is 5.16%, while the net margin median is 3.29%. Dr. Reddys is a high-flyer compared to most of the industry.\n\nThe margins are greater than they were five years ago, so I would grudgingly say they are expanding, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nAnnual report\n\nHow likely is the company to remain profitable, predictable and margin expansive? To assess this, I have taken a look at the company's latest 10K for 2022.\n\nIn its annual report for 2022, management reported, In FY22, we filed 10 Drug Master Files and seven ANDAs in the U.S., and launched 157 products across markets. As we can see, the company is growing its pipeline.\n\nIt also noted it is ready to grow through acquisitions:\n\nAll of this is part of a consistent strategic orientation:\n\nI always like to see continuous improvement initiatives, because they mean a company is focused on its costs, but not necessarily to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nDr. Reddys also cites continuing growth industry-wide:\n\nLooking forward, analysts at Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN) expect EPS without NRI to increase from $2.67 per share last year to $2.88 per share for the current year, then $3.17 per share for the two subsequent years.\n\nOverall, I believe Dr. Reddys Laboratories deserves its place on the screener. It appears to offer slow but steady growth potential for patient investors.",

Reaffirms full-year Company guidance.The Company is also currently working with lenders to secure financing to support a potential accretive acquisition.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nFirst Quarter 2023\n\nTotal revenue for Q1 2023 was $66.3 million, compared to $115.9 million in Q1 2022.Q1 2023 net income was $5.8 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $44.1 million, or $3.47 per basic and $3.41 per diluted share, in Q1 2022.Q1 2023 adjusted non-GAAP net income was $16.5 million, or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $52.2 million, or $4.10 per basic and $4.04 per diluted share, in Q1 2022.Cash and cash equivalents were $21.9 million, net accounts receivable was $115.0 million, and total debt was $77.5 million, as of March 31, 2023.\n\n\"Following on from our outstanding performance in 2022, we believe Eagle remains well positioned for another strong year, and therefore we are reiterating our 2023 guidance. Our products continue to track well, and we are on pace to surpass our 2022 net product sales for the full year 2023 for PEMFEXY, which continues to gain share in commercial (non-340B) pemetrexed usage in the U.S.,\" stated Scott Tarriff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"To be clear, the investments we are making for the future account for much of the expected difference of our earnings in 2023 versus 2022. We are investing to support our products and advance our pipeline, notably CAL02, which bridges much of the year-over-year gap. We believe the expansion of our commercial team will enable us to capture synergies with an acquisition target and are currently working with lenders to secure financing to support a potentially accretive transaction,\" concluded Tarriff.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Financial Results\n\nTotal revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $66.3 million, as compared to $115.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 RYANODEX® net product sales were $8.8 million, compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 BELRAPZO net product sales were $6.4 million, compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 PEMFEXY net product sales were $22.9 million, compared to $37.2 million in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 vasopressin net product sales were $3.5 million, compared to $34.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company gave notice to customers and the FDA that it was withdrawing from the vasopressin market. Inventory on hand is expected to be depleted by the end of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nQ1 2023 royalty revenue was $20.1 million, compared to $25.8 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nA summary of total revenue is outlined below:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (unaudited) (unaudited) Revenue (in thousands): Product sales, net$46,221 $90,088 Royalty revenue 20,084 25,786 Total revenue$66,305 $115,874\n\nGross margin was 74% during the first quarter of 2023, compared to 76% in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the inclusion of amortization of intangible assets related to the newly acquired products, which we expect to continue going forward.\n\nR&D expense was $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher spend of $2.0 million on CAL02 and $1.0 million on Byfavo and Barhemsys pediatric studies.\n\nSG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $28.0 million compared to $22.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. This increase was driven by $3.3 million in salary and other personnel-related costs, $2.0 million in external sales and marketing spend, partially offset by $2.0 million in lower legal-related costs.\n\nNet income for the first quarter of 2023 was $5.8 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $44.1 million, or $3.47 per basic and $3.41 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $16.5 million, or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $52.2 million, or $4.10 per basic and $4.04 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023 was $22.3 million, compared to adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of $66.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n2023 Full-Year Guidance\n\nThe Company continues to expect:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $74.0-$80.0 millionAdjusted non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.20-$4.53Adjusted non-GAAP R&D expense of $41.0-$45.0 millionAdjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense of $86.0-$90.0 million\n\nLiquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, Eagle had $21.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $115.0 million in accounts receivable, net, and $77.5 million in outstanding debt on the Company's $150 million credit facility with JPMorgan.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risk that the anticipated benefits of the Company's acquisition of Acacia are not realized; the ability of Enalare to achieve milestones and deliverables and achieve successful results in the development of ENA-001 and the Company's ability to exercise its option to acquire the remaining outstanding share capital of Enalare; the impacts of the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events such as the conflict in Ukraine, including disruption or impact in the sales of the Company's marketed products, interruptions or other adverse effects to clinical trials, delays in regulatory review, manufacturing and supply chain interruptions, adverse effects on healthcare systems, disruption in the operations of the Company's third party partners and disruption of the global economy or other events on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations; macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and interest rates, uncertain credit and financial markets and recent and potential disruptions in banking systems; whether the Company will incur unforeseen expenses or liabilities or other market factors; whether the Company will successfully implement its development plan for its product candidates; delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approval of the Company's or its partners' product candidates; whether the Company can successfully market and commercialize its product candidates; the success of the Company's relationships with its partners; the availability and pricing of third party sourced products and materials; the outcome of litigation involving any of its products or that may have an impact on any of our products; successful compliance with the FDA and other governmental regulations applicable to product approvals, manufacturing facilities, products and/or businesses; general economic conditions, including the potential adverse effects of public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events, on economic activity and the performance of the financial markets generally; the strength and enforceability of the Company's intellectual property rights or the rights of third parties; competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the potential for competition from generic entrants into the market; the risks inherent in the early stages of drug development and in conducting clinical trials; and any unanticipated factors in addition to the foregoing that may impact the Company's financial and business projections and guidance and may cause the Company's actual results and outcomes to materially differ from its projections and guidance; and those risks and uncertainties identified in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 23, 2023, and its other subsequent filings with the SEC, including the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date on which they were made. Except to the extent required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\n\nIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release also contains adjusted non-GAAP net income, adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share, adjusted non-GAAP R&D expense and adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense and projected adjusted non-GAAP R&D expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share and adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense. The Company believes these measures provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP net income and related earnings per share information excludes amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, severance, acquisition related costs, legal settlement, non-cash interest expense, fair value adjustments on equity investment, convertible promissory note related adjustments, fair value adjustments related to derivative instruments, foreign currency exchange gain, inventory step-up, and the tax effect of these adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments on equity investment, convertible promissory note related adjustments, fair value adjustments related to derivative instruments, foreign currency exchange gain, gain on euro debt, legal settlement, acquisition related costs, inventory step-up, debt issuance cost and severance.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP R&D expense excludes stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense.\n\nAdjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense excludes stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, severance, acquisition related costs and legal settlement.\n\nThe Company believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures helps indicate underlying trends in the Company's business and are important in comparing current results with prior period results and understanding projected operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures provide the Company and its investors with an indication of the Company's baseline performance before items that are considered by the Company not to be reflective of the Company's ongoing results. See the attached reconciliation tables for details of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at certain of the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nInvestors should note that reconciliations of the forward-looking or projected non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to their most comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided because the Company cannot do so without unreasonable efforts due to the unavailability of information needed to calculate the reconciling items and the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of comparable GAAP measures, and the reconciling items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in the future. Likewise, the Company is unable to provide projected GAAP financial measures. GAAP projections and reconciliations of the components of projected adjusted EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP R&D expenses, adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense, and adjusted non-GAAP earning per share to their most comparable GAAP financial measures are not provided because the quantification of projected GAAP R&D expenses, adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense, net income and earnings per share and the reconciling items between projected GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP R&D expenses, adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, with respect to GAAP net income, R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, the Company is not able to calculate the favorable or unfavorable expenses related to the fair value adjustments on equity investments and derivative instruments primarily due to nature of these items. Such unavailable information could be significant such that actual GAAP net income, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses and earnings per share would vary significantly from projected adjusted EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP R&D expenses, adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. For example, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company no longer excludes expense of acquired in-process research & development from the Company's adjusted non-GAAP net income or adjusted EBITDA, their line item components, and non-GAAP earnings per share. For purposes of comparability, non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three ended March 31, 2022 have been updated to reflect this change. Accordingly, such expenses are not excluded from its non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, or from 2023 non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. The Company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\n\nInvestor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:\n\nLisa M.

The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAvoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders, electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g., ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nCommon adverse reactions reported in = 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%), hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%), procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%), and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).\n\nSerum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.\n\nThe most common adverse reaction, reported in = 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416), in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).\n\nUse in Specific Populations\n\nLactation\n\nAmisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.\n\nBARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial, serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.\n\nTo minimize exposure to a breastfed infant, lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.\n\nPediatric Use\n\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\nGeriatric Use\n\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\nRenal Impairment\n\nAvoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.\n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment\n\n(eGFR = 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects, avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., ondansetron).Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g., levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.\n\nImportant Safety Information for BYFAVO (remimazolam)8 Injection\n\nIndications\n\nBYFAVO is a benzodiazepine indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nWARNING: PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING AND RESUSCITATION AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOID ANALGESICS\n\nPersonnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation\n\nOnly personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. BYFAVO has been associated with hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period.Resuscitative drugs, and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask-assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.\n\nRisks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-Hypnotics\n\nConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including BYFAVO, and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.\n\nContraindication\n\nBYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.\n\nPersonnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation\n\nClinically notable hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension were observed in Phase 3 studies of BYFAVO. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. Resuscitative drugs, and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask-assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO. Consider the potential for worsened cardiorespiratory depression prior to using BYFAVO concomitantly with other drugs that have the same potential (e.g., opioid analgesics or other sedative-hypnotics). Administer supplemental oxygen to sedated patients through the recovery period. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.\n\nRisks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-Hypnotics\n\nConcomitant use of BYFAVO and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of IV BYFAVO can be accentuated when administered with other CNS depressant medications (eg, other benzodiazepines and propofol). Titrate the dose of BYFAVO when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA-PS class III or IV patients.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions\n\nBYFAVO contains dextran 40, which can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, and anaphylaxis. BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.\n\nNeonatal Sedation\n\nUse of benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and manage accordingly.\n\nPediatric Neurotoxicity\n\nPublished animal studies demonstrate that anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of this is not clear. However, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.\n\nAnesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients (N=630) receiving BYFAVO 5-30 mg (total dose) and undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study) were: hypotension, hypertension, diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension, hypoxia, and diastolic hypotension.\n\nUse in Specific Populations\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data on the specific effects of BYFAVO on pregnancy. Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.\n\nLactation\n\nMonitor infants exposed to BYFAVO through breast milk for sedation, respiratory depression, and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 5 hours after BYFAVO administration.\n\nPediatric Use\n\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. BYFAVO should not be used in patients less than 18 years of age.\n\nGeriatric Use\n\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, there is a potential for greater sensitivity (eg, faster onset, oversedation, confusion) in some older individuals. Administer supplemental doses of BYFAVO slowly to achieve the level of sedation required and monitor all patients closely for cardiorespiratory complications.\n\nHepatic Impairment\n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dose of BYFAVO should be carefully titrated to effect. Depending on the overall status of the patient, lower frequency of supplemental doses may be needed to achieve the level of sedation required for the procedure. All patients should be monitored for sedation-related cardiorespiratory complications.\n\nAbuse and Dependence\n\nBYFAVO is a federally controlled substance (CIV) because it contains remimazolam which has the potential for abuse and physical dependence.\n\n1 Adjusted non-GAAP net income, adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share, adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA, adjusted non-GAAP R&D expense and adjusted non-GAAP SG&A expense are non-GAAP financial measures.

            "body": "Scott Tarriff - President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nBrian Cahill - Chief Financial Officer\n\nMike Greenberg - Vice President of Medical Affairs\n\nGood morning, everyone. My name is Todd and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Eagle Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2023 Financial Results. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. May 9, 2023.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ms. Lisa Wilson, Investor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals. Please go ahead.\n\nLisa Wilson\n\nThank you, Carl. Welcome to Eagle Pharmaceuticals first quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Lisa Wilson, Investor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals. With me on today's call are Eagle's President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Tarriff; Chief Financial Officer, Brian Cahill; and Vice President of Medical Affairs, Dr. Mike Greenberg.\n\nThis morning Eagle issued a press release detailing its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This press release and a webcast of this call can be accessed through the investor section of the Eagle website at eagle.us.com.\n\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind everyone that any statements made on today's conference call that express a belief, expectations, projection, forecasts, anticipation or intent regarding future events and the company's future performance may be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Since then, Eagle may have made announcements related to the topics discussed, so please refer to the company's most recent press releases and SEC filings. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during this conference call in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA description of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures are set forth in our earnings press release available on our website at eagle.us.com.\n\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Eagle's President and CEO, Scott Tarriff.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nWell, thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today.\n\nFollowing on from the outstanding year Eagle had in 2022, we remain well-positioned for another strong year in 2023. Our products continue to do well as you can see from the strong earnings we announced this morning. We expect this momentum to continue and our longer-term growth come from our pipeline of potential acquisitions.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, our net income was $5.8 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share and adjusted non-GAAP earnings was 16.5 million or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share. Our adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA was 22.3 million for the first quarter. This positions us well to achieve our full year '23 guidance, which we reaffirmed. To be clear investments we are making for the future account for much of the expected difference of our earnings in 2023 versus 2022. We are investing to support our products and advance our pipeline, notably CAL02, which bridges much of the year-over-year gap.\n\nWith the commercial infrastructure already in place, we believe we will be able to capture synergies through a potential acquisition target.\n\nLet's look at the products. During the first quarter of '23, PEMFEXY net product sales totaled $22.9 million. And we believe we are well on our way to surpassing the $67 million recorded for the full year of 2022.\n\nAs you recall, we exited the fourth quarter of last year with a 6% share of commercial, non-340B pemetrexed usage in community oncology in the United States. Based on the internal data and customer feedback, we estimate that as of the second quarter to-date, that our share has now grown to 15%. We expect growth to continue throughout the year and believe that the market share at the end of Q2 could be greater than the current 15%. PEMFEXY remains an important asset for us as you recall, we eliminated the royalty on the first $85 million of profit on PEMFEXY beginning October 1, '22 and a reduced royalty thereafter in exchange for a one-time payment of $15 million. So far that is looking like a great decision.\n\nMoving on to our Bendamustine franchise. As we have discussed in the past our bendamustine franchise face new competition for the first time beginning on December 7, 2022. Since that time, we continued to be pleased with the strong performance of BENDEKA and BELRAPZO in the marketplace. It is our belief that BENDEKA is a beneficial product for patients and healthcare providers. Together, BENDEKA and BELRAPZO maintained approximately 89% share of the bendamustine U.S. market for the first quarter of '23 compared to approximately 90% historically.\n\nIn the first quarter, we reached the settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's, Eagle's asserted its orange book listed patents against Dr. Reddy's related to its new drug application referencing BENDEKA. The settlement follows our previously announced settlements with Hospira and Accord Healthcare related to their new drug applications referencing BENDEKA.\n\nOther than one recent challenger, which is for a proposed powder not liquid formulation all existing cases have now been settled. We remain confident in exclusivity into November of '27, which we believe positions bendamustine to be a significant contributor for several more years.\n\nTurning now to the Acacia products, BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO combined net sales of the two products totaled just shy of $1 million in the first quarter. Our BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO product sales are up 32% sequentially versus Q4 of '22. Although this is a small base, it is a very solid showing, and we expect their shares to continue to grow nicely.\n\nJust last week, we announced that CMS established a unique product specific billing code for BYFAVO, which as you may recall, is a short acting sedative for procedures lasting 30 minutes or less. This new J-Code is effective on July 1 of '23. We believe the establishment of a unique J-Code for BYFAVO is an important step in facilitating reimbursement and broadening access to this innovative sedation drug.\n\nOur go-forward business development plans remain intact. As we've stated in the past, we intend to use our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility to potentially make an accretive acquisition, with the aim to broaden our footprint within the acute care or oncology space and solidify our foundation for future growth.\n\nWe are also currently working with lenders to secure financing to support a potential accretive acquisition.\n\nLet me make a few comments on the pipeline. First, a global Phase 2 studies underway for CAL02, a novel first-in-class agent for the treatment of severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia used in addition to standard of care, including antibiotic treatment. We expect to enroll 276 patients in 120 centers in 22 countries.\n\nSecond, ENA-001 an investigational one-of-a-kind new chemical entity is an agnostic respiratory stimulant being developed by Enalare for the potential treatment of post-operative respiratory depression, community drug overdose and apnea of prematurity. As a reminder, we acquired approximately 17% equity stake in Enalare in exchange for two upfront investments paid in August of '22 and February of '23, and we have an option to purchase the rest of Enalare in the events specified milestones are achieved.\n\nThird, Landiolol NDA is under review at FDA, the filing seeks approval for Landiolol for the short-term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with super ventricular tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. To recap, as you can see, we had another impressive quarter. Our plan is to accelerate long-term growth through potential acquisitions and our pipeline. We believe that we are in a good position to execute on all three aspects of our business, namely, strength from our existing product line, potential future accretive acquisitions, and the development of our pipeline\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Cahill to discuss our first quarter financials. Brian?\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, total revenue was $66.3 million, compared to $115.9 million in the prior year. Net product sales during the first quarter of 2023 were $46.2 million, compared to $90.1 million in Q1 2022, our launch quarter for both PEMFEXY and vasopressin. PEMFEXY, net product sales were $22.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 37.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. We recorded revenue on delivery of our product to our direct customers, primarily wholesalers, which estimates the current and near-term needs of the wholesaler channel for our growing product. As we continue to capture more share of the pemetrexed market, customer inventory levels may be higher than for similar established product. Vasopressin, net product sales were $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, as previously announced during the first quarter of 2023, we notified customers and the FDA, and our decision to withdraw from the vasopressin market.\n\nOur inventory on hand has been depleted at this time. BELRAPZO, net product sales increased to $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $5.9 million in Q1 of 2022. And first quarter 2023, RYANODEX net product sales were $8.8 million, compared to 6.6 million in Q1 of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 royalty revenue was $20.1 million compared to $25.8 million in the prior year quarter. Royalty revenues included royalties earned on sales of BENDEKA in the U.S. and TREAKISYM in Japan. Gross margin was 74% in Q1 2023, compared to 76% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the inclusion of amortization of intangible assets related to the newly acquired products, BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO, which we expect will continue going forward.\n\nOn the expense front, R&D expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $6.1 million in Q1 of 2022. This increase is largely attributable to continuing CMC and clinical trial spend on CAL02 program and BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO pediatric studies. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, first quarter 2023 non-GAAP R&D expense was $8.6 million.\n\nSG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $28 million, compared to $22.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. This increase was driven by $3.3 million in salary and other personnel related costs, $2 million in external sales and marketing spend partially offset by $2 million in lower legal related costs. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, first quarter 2023 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $23.9 million.\n\nNet income for the first quarter of 2023 was $5.8 million or 0.44 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $44.1 million or $3.47 per basic and $3.41 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $16.5 million or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $52.2 million or $4.10 per basic and $4.04 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA was $22.3 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFor a full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the table at the end of our earnings press release. As of March 31, 2023, the company had $21.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $150 million in net accounts receivable and $77.5 million in outstanding debt.\n\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to please open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.\n\nThank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair.\n\nLachlan Hanbury-Brown\n\nHey guys, is Lachlan on for Tim. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. On the announcement for securing the financing for the deal and where you are in that stage, just curious on the rationale for announcing that now rather than wait until everything is fully signed, sealed and delivered. And then, Brian on that, just wanted to check if the guidance you guys provided earlier in the year included any consideration for [indiscernible]?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nAll right. Thanks for the question. Let me pick up the whitespace something now. It's just simple. We're working hard at it. We've been speaking about the potential of an acquisition for a number of quarters now. We're just very deliberate in our actions and very selective about what we do. But we are moving forward as aggressively as we can to find the right opportunity. And this was just a sign that we take the business development and the M&A actions seriously. And we are lining up lenders. So we're in a position to transact as soon as practicable.\n\nIn terms of the guidance, Brian, do you have anything to add?\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nSure. Our guidance does not contemplate the completion and integration of any M&A. But those have a sliver of investigational work in our G&A naturally, since we've been doing that for over a year.\n\nLachlan Hanbury-Brown\n\nThanks. Yes. That's helpful. And I guess, ahead of land deal PDUFA. Scott, curious about the sort of what we should be expecting for the launch timing. Are you planning to sort of let the sales team loose with that immediately? Or will you be spending a couple of quarters trying to gain access before they sort of take it out into the field?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes. That's a great point. Depending on the timing of the approval, we wind up with an approval that could be happening going into the summer months, and probably launching a drug into the summer isn't the most effective way to handle it, especially considering that we're so pleased with the traction we're starting to get with the two Acacia products.\n\nAgain, small base, but this was only the really the first quarter. It's the last two quarters that we've had the full territories and everybody in full strength. And we picked up the 32% growth in the Acacia products, you don't want anything to get in the way, launching landiolol. So we're probably better off waiting a little bit, get through a couple more quarters with the Acacia products and not trying to launch something in the middle of summertime.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Folkes with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the very strong quarter. Let me firstly, on PEMFEXY. Can you talk about any sort of benefits in 1Q '23 that may not be here for the rest of the year, any one time as well? How should we think about the cadence of quarters in 2023? And then along those lines, seems like the generic arbitrage is pretty well behind us here. So just is that fair thinking? [Indiscernible] add-ons?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes, Brandon. So PEMFEXY is really shaping up to be really wonderful for us going from the 6% share in Q4 to where we are right now at 15% is really very encouraging. My guess is, as we stated today based on how we see the trends running, speaking to our customers and just watching this all unfold that 15% is going to just continue throughout the year to grow. How high it goes, it's just too difficult to predict right now. But with the -- just shy of $23 million we had in Q1, relative to the $67 million that we sold in all of last year, our forecast that will sell more than last year's numbers, and '23 is probably looking pretty good. There's always ins and outs you can't predict in pricing and inventory levels. But we would expect, what we're seeing now is that $67 million number for the year is looking pretty darn good. We're pretty pleased about the $15 million, we spent to buy back that first $85 million of profit. So our expectation is that the shares just going to continue to grow. And we're pretty good place for the year as it relates to PEMFEXY, and couldn't be more pleased with the way launch is going.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. I may just changing speed to BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO. Can you just provide any feedback you're getting from the field? How should we think about these going forward, just sort of a normal kind of hospital type launch where just sort of takes a bit of time? Or kind of any color you can provide there in terms of how should we think about maybe the sales?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nBrandon, I'm thrilled you asked that question. I would tell you from our standpoint, here, internally, we're more excited about these two products than we were when we made the acquisition a year ago. The feedback that we're getting has really been tremendous from the users of the product, the nurses and the physicians and the feedback we're getting from those two groups, by the way, the patients feel about the products.\n\nAs we all know, there's a ramp process that goes through to be able to establish these products in the hospital. And we're really, I mean, we're extremely pleased with the trajectory so far, 32% growth in a quarter, we expect that market share that growth to just continue. The feedback has been really just wonderful. We're doing a lot the J-Code helps. I think we're just going to have a nice steady ramp out through time and remember, these products are both protected into the early 30, so we have plenty of time and it's going well.\n\nWe have Dr. Greenberg, with us who's much closer with the physicians and the nurses that we speak to. Mike maybe want to say a couple of short comments about what you're hearing about the two products.\n\nMike Greenberg\n\nSure, Scott. Thank you. I just like to reiterate the feedback that you shared. On the medical affairs side, we've been hearing exactly the same, exactly the same thing. So regarding BARHEMSYS, we're starting to see some real-world evidence percolate into meetings and being published, that data echoes what we've seen in our pivotal trials. And in fact, in some cases surpasses it. So this is a drug that really seemed to be over delivering at this point, at least to a certain extent, on the BYFAVO side, was a great increase in accounts that are using BYFAVO as well. And again, the feedback has been extraordinary, helping patient throughput, patients are being sedated for their procedures more rapidly, waking up alert and moving on to the very high level of satisfaction in both the health care providers. And for the patient's medical affairs team was really excited about these products, and some of the sales team.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nSo conclusion, Brandon, I would say that we're just expecting nice steady growth over the next several years and many quarters and it compounds. And if you just keep having really nice solid growth like this quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter, you can see where these two products build in a relatively short period of time. And what we've been stating, as we project where the company is going. Fortunately, the products that we sell today are doing rather well, right, another strong quarter. We've had several strong quarters of performance now with the products that we sell, '23 is probably going to be another very strong year for the company that gives us time to build the foundation of BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO. And you can just see if this growth continues by the time you get to '24, '25 and '26. These products can start to be a very significant portion of our earnings and our growth. So far, less than a year into the acquisition, recently having all the territories at full strength we're pretty excited and pleased about where we are so far and where we're going.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nRight Thanks. One more for me just a clarifying question on the prior question. I mean, talk about the fact that you're working with lenders for an acquisition, does this imply you have a target that you're ready to move on right now? Or are you subject to the financing? Or are you just trying to line up the financing, so you can move quickly, when you do find a suitable target? That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes. There's not much more Brandon, we can say about that, other than the fact that we've been talking about it for a while, and this is just trying to convey to everybody that we are working diligently and we're very focused. We believe we're in a very unique situation, right? As the industry starts to unfold, if we just take a step back, when we acquired Acacia, there were 70 people in that organization and we were able to just run that business with 20, not the full 70 that they had. And the way we've built our infrastructure here at Eagle and the way we've prudently managed our cash and our balance sheet, we believe that we can make a very significant acquisition relative to our size and have similar reduction in cost. And so we can probably take in another large product, probably more in the oncology space than the hospital space right now, and probably bring in a really tremendous amount of synergy when we bring -- if we bring a company into the organization. And it's a unique situation that we find ourselves in, one, having the infrastructure to be able to take advantage of the synergy. And two, having the financial wherewithal to make a rather large accretive situation. And so based on the historical, positive situation we find ourselves in right now, having those factors come together, we have to be aggressive, we need to take advantage of it. It's an opportunity, we can't pass for our shareholders. And so we're very focused, we'll just have to see how things unfold over time here. But the message is, we do take this seriously and we are trying our best to be able to bring a company into Eagle and take advantage of all of this.\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from David Amsellem with Piper Sandler.\n\nDavid Amsellem\n\nThanks. So just a couple. Can you size up the opportunity for landiolol, and more interested in particular how you think about the initial ramp here? So that's number one. Number two is, I know, there's a lot you can't say. But can you about the acquisition or what you're contemplating. But I guess the question here is just thinking more broadly, are you still very much wedded to the hospital space given just the financial pressures that we're seeing in the space? Do you want to think more expansively about the business? Or is this mainly just hospital focused? Thank you.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nDavid, thank you, for all of that. Let's take the second question first and talk a little bit more about the acquisition. We just spent a lot of time speaking about the BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO situation. And it does, it takes a lot of effort. And we're very pleased with the ramp. And we have the hospital business that I would call more saturated right now because we do have the two products that we're in launch mode for. And then as you bring up in your first question, we have the landiolol situation coming up once it's approved.\n\nAnd so I would say it's probably more likely that an acquisition that we make in the short-term, would fall more in the oncology space, then it would in the hospital space. Mostly, the oncology business right now is just a wonderful place to be in the country. We think we can help a number of patients and at the same time, help our shareholders, but it's the oncology side of our business where we have so much room from an infrastructure standpoint.\n\nI think, if I can try to explain this, the clearest way I can, we can probably bring a significant oncology product into our company right now, without needing a heck of a lot of additional expense. I don't mean direct marketing from that standpoint, but the infrastructure that we have could probably support a large oncology product with a minimal amount of additional spending. And so that's the situation we need to take advantage of.\n\nSo if we're able to do what we're hoping to do, it's likely -- it's more likely to be on the oncology side and the hospital side right now. And that goes into your landiolol question, right? We will launch it, it will ramp that's the way these products work. And it'll be the same type of ramp that you normally see in the hospital space. It'll just fortify what we have, we'll see how that goes. But we are very concentrated right now in oncology.\n\nThank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Scott Tarriff for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nWell, thank you, everyone for joining the call today. Clearly, obviously, we believe we're poised for another solid year in '23. We look forward to updating you as we advance our business plans. We think we have really a very strong vision of the future. Let's see how it unfolds. And as always, we appreciate your ongoing support for Eagle. Thank you, everybody and stay well.\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "body": "Scott Tarriff - President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nBrian Cahill - Chief Financial Officer\n\nMike Greenberg - Vice President of Medical Affairs\n\nGood morning, everyone. My name is Todd and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Eagle Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2023 Financial Results. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. May 9, 2023.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ms. Lisa Wilson, Investor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals. Please go ahead.\n\nLisa Wilson\n\nThank you, Carl. Welcome to Eagle Pharmaceuticals first quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Lisa Wilson, Investor Relations for Eagle Pharmaceuticals. With me on today's call are Eagle's President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Tarriff; Chief Financial Officer, Brian Cahill; and Vice President of Medical Affairs, Dr. Mike Greenberg.\n\nThis morning Eagle issued a press release detailing its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This press release and a webcast of this call can be accessed through the investor section of the Eagle website at eagle.us.com.\n\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind everyone that any statements made on today's conference call that express a belief, expectations, projection, forecasts, anticipation or intent regarding future events and the company's future performance may be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Since then, Eagle may have made announcements related to the topics discussed, so please refer to the company's most recent press releases and SEC filings. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures during this conference call in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA description of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures are set forth in our earnings press release available on our website at eagle.us.com.\n\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Eagle's President and CEO, Scott Tarriff.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nWell, thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today.\n\nFollowing on from the outstanding year Eagle had in 2022, we remain well-positioned for another strong year in 2023. Our products continue to do well as you can see from the strong earnings we announced this morning. We expect this momentum to continue and our longer-term growth come from our pipeline of potential acquisitions.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, our net income was $5.8 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share and adjusted non-GAAP earnings was 16.5 million or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share. Our adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA was 22.3 million for the first quarter. This positions us well to achieve our full year '23 guidance, which we reaffirmed. To be clear investments we are making for the future account for much of the expected difference of our earnings in 2023 versus 2022. We are investing to support our products and advance our pipeline, notably CAL02, which bridges much of the year-over-year gap.\n\nWith the commercial infrastructure already in place, we believe we will be able to capture synergies through a potential acquisition target.\n\nLet's look at the products. During the first quarter of '23, PEMFEXY net product sales totaled $22.9 million. And we believe we are well on our way to surpassing the $67 million recorded for the full year of 2022.\n\nAs you recall, we exited the fourth quarter of last year with a 6% share of commercial, non-340B pemetrexed usage in community oncology in the United States. Based on the internal data and customer feedback, we estimate that as of the second quarter to-date, that our share has now grown to 15%. We expect growth to continue throughout the year and believe that the market share at the end of Q2 could be greater than the current 15%. PEMFEXY remains an important asset for us as you recall, we eliminated the royalty on the first $85 million of profit on PEMFEXY beginning October 1, '22 and a reduced royalty thereafter in exchange for a one-time payment of $15 million. So far that is looking like a great decision.\n\nMoving on to our Bendamustine franchise. As we have discussed in the past our bendamustine franchise face new competition for the first time beginning on December 7, 2022. Since that time, we continued to be pleased with the strong performance of BENDEKA and BELRAPZO in the marketplace. It is our belief that BENDEKA is a beneficial product for patients and healthcare providers. Together, BENDEKA and BELRAPZO maintained approximately 89% share of the bendamustine U.S. market for the first quarter of '23 compared to approximately 90% historically.\n\nIn the first quarter, we reached the settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's, Eagle's asserted its orange book listed patents against Dr. Reddy's related to its new drug application referencing BENDEKA. The settlement follows our previously announced settlements with Hospira and Accord Healthcare related to their new drug applications referencing BENDEKA.\n\nOther than one recent challenger, which is for a proposed powder not liquid formulation all existing cases have now been settled. We remain confident in exclusivity into November of '27, which we believe positions bendamustine to be a significant contributor for several more years.\n\nTurning now to the Acacia products, BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO combined net sales of the two products totaled just shy of $1 million in the first quarter. Our BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO product sales are up 32% sequentially versus Q4 of '22. Although this is a small base, it is a very solid showing, and we expect their shares to continue to grow nicely.\n\nJust last week, we announced that CMS established a unique product specific billing code for BYFAVO, which as you may recall, is a short acting sedative for procedures lasting 30 minutes or less. This new J-Code is effective on July 1 of '23. We believe the establishment of a unique J-Code for BYFAVO is an important step in facilitating reimbursement and broadening access to this innovative sedation drug.\n\nOur go-forward business development plans remain intact. As we've stated in the past, we intend to use our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility to potentially make an accretive acquisition, with the aim to broaden our footprint within the acute care or oncology space and solidify our foundation for future growth.\n\nWe are also currently working with lenders to secure financing to support a potential accretive acquisition.\n\nLet me make a few comments on the pipeline. First, a global Phase 2 studies underway for CAL02, a novel first-in-class agent for the treatment of severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia used in addition to standard of care, including antibiotic treatment. We expect to enroll 276 patients in 120 centers in 22 countries.\n\nSecond, ENA-001 an investigational one-of-a-kind new chemical entity is an agnostic respiratory stimulant being developed by Enalare for the potential treatment of post-operative respiratory depression, community drug overdose and apnea of prematurity. As a reminder, we acquired approximately 17% equity stake in Enalare in exchange for two upfront investments paid in August of '22 and February of '23, and we have an option to purchase the rest of Enalare in the events specified milestones are achieved.\n\nThird, Landiolol NDA is under review at FDA, the filing seeks approval for Landiolol for the short-term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with super ventricular tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. To recap, as you can see, we had another impressive quarter. Our plan is to accelerate long-term growth through potential acquisitions and our pipeline. We believe that we are in a good position to execute on all three aspects of our business, namely, strength from our existing product line, potential future accretive acquisitions, and the development of our pipeline\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Cahill to discuss our first quarter financials. Brian?\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, total revenue was $66.3 million, compared to $115.9 million in the prior year. Net product sales during the first quarter of 2023 were $46.2 million, compared to $90.1 million in Q1 2022, our launch quarter for both PEMFEXY and vasopressin. PEMFEXY, net product sales were $22.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 37.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. We recorded revenue on delivery of our product to our direct customers, primarily wholesalers, which estimates the current and near-term needs of the wholesaler channel for our growing product. As we continue to capture more share of the pemetrexed market, customer inventory levels may be higher than for similar established product. Vasopressin, net product sales were $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, as previously announced during the first quarter of 2023, we notified customers and the FDA, and our decision to withdraw from the vasopressin market.\n\nOur inventory on hand has been depleted at this time. BELRAPZO, net product sales increased to $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $5.9 million in Q1 of 2022. And first quarter 2023, RYANODEX net product sales were $8.8 million, compared to 6.6 million in Q1 of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 royalty revenue was $20.1 million compared to $25.8 million in the prior year quarter. Royalty revenues included royalties earned on sales of BENDEKA in the U.S. and TREAKISYM in Japan. Gross margin was 74% in Q1 2023, compared to 76% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the inclusion of amortization of intangible assets related to the newly acquired products, BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO, which we expect will continue going forward.\n\nOn the expense front, R&D expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $6.1 million in Q1 of 2022. This increase is largely attributable to continuing CMC and clinical trial spend on CAL02 program and BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO pediatric studies. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, first quarter 2023 non-GAAP R&D expense was $8.6 million.\n\nSG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $28 million, compared to $22.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. This increase was driven by $3.3 million in salary and other personnel related costs, $2 million in external sales and marketing spend partially offset by $2 million in lower legal related costs. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, first quarter 2023 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $23.9 million.\n\nNet income for the first quarter of 2023 was $5.8 million or 0.44 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $44.1 million or $3.47 per basic and $3.41 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $16.5 million or $1.27 per basic and $1.26 per diluted share compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $52.2 million or $4.10 per basic and $4.04 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA was $22.3 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFor a full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the table at the end of our earnings press release. As of March 31, 2023, the company had $21.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $150 million in net accounts receivable and $77.5 million in outstanding debt.\n\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to please open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.\n\nThank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair.\n\nLachlan Hanbury-Brown\n\nHey guys, is Lachlan on for Tim. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. On the announcement for securing the financing for the deal and where you are in that stage, just curious on the rationale for announcing that now rather than wait until everything is fully signed, sealed and delivered. And then, Brian on that, just wanted to check if the guidance you guys provided earlier in the year included any consideration for [indiscernible]?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nAll right. Thanks for the question. Let me pick up the whitespace something now. It's just simple. We're working hard at it. We've been speaking about the potential of an acquisition for a number of quarters now. We're just very deliberate in our actions and very selective about what we do. But we are moving forward as aggressively as we can to find the right opportunity. And this was just a sign that we take the business development and the M&A actions seriously. And we are lining up lenders. So we're in a position to transact as soon as practicable.\n\nIn terms of the guidance, Brian, do you have anything to add?\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nSure. Our guidance does not contemplate the completion and integration of any M&A. But those have a sliver of investigational work in our G&A naturally, since we've been doing that for over a year.\n\nLachlan Hanbury-Brown\n\nThanks. Yes. That's helpful. And I guess, ahead of land deal PDUFA. Scott, curious about the sort of what we should be expecting for the launch timing. Are you planning to sort of let the sales team loose with that immediately? Or will you be spending a couple of quarters trying to gain access before they sort of take it out into the field?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes. That's a great point. Depending on the timing of the approval, we wind up with an approval that could be happening going into the summer months, and probably launching a drug into the summer isn't the most effective way to handle it, especially considering that we're so pleased with the traction we're starting to get with the two Acacia products.\n\nAgain, small base, but this was only the really the first quarter. It's the last two quarters that we've had the full territories and everybody in full strength. And we picked up the 32% growth in the Acacia products, you don't want anything to get in the way, launching landiolol. So we're probably better off waiting a little bit, get through a couple more quarters with the Acacia products and not trying to launch something in the middle of summertime.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Folkes with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the very strong quarter. Let me firstly, on PEMFEXY. Can you talk about any sort of benefits in 1Q '23 that may not be here for the rest of the year, any one time as well? How should we think about the cadence of quarters in 2023? And then along those lines, seems like the generic arbitrage is pretty well behind us here. So just is that fair thinking? [Indiscernible] add-ons?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes, Brandon. So PEMFEXY is really shaping up to be really wonderful for us going from the 6% share in Q4 to where we are right now at 15% is really very encouraging. My guess is, as we stated today based on how we see the trends running, speaking to our customers and just watching this all unfold that 15% is going to just continue throughout the year to grow. How high it goes, it's just too difficult to predict right now. But with the -- just shy of $23 million we had in Q1, relative to the $67 million that we sold in all of last year, our forecast that will sell more than last year's numbers, and '23 is probably looking pretty good. There's always ins and outs you can't predict in pricing and inventory levels. But we would expect, what we're seeing now is that $67 million number for the year is looking pretty darn good. We're pretty pleased about the $15 million, we spent to buy back that first $85 million of profit. So our expectation is that the shares just going to continue to grow. And we're pretty good place for the year as it relates to PEMFEXY, and couldn't be more pleased with the way launch is going.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. I may just changing speed to BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO. Can you just provide any feedback you're getting from the field? How should we think about these going forward, just sort of a normal kind of hospital type launch where just sort of takes a bit of time? Or kind of any color you can provide there in terms of how should we think about maybe the sales?\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nBrandon, I'm thrilled you asked that question. I would tell you from our standpoint, here, internally, we're more excited about these two products than we were when we made the acquisition a year ago. The feedback that we're getting has really been tremendous from the users of the product, the nurses and the physicians and the feedback we're getting from those two groups, by the way, the patients feel about the products.\n\nAs we all know, there's a ramp process that goes through to be able to establish these products in the hospital. And we're really, I mean, we're extremely pleased with the trajectory so far, 32% growth in a quarter, we expect that market share that growth to just continue. The feedback has been really just wonderful. We're doing a lot the J-Code helps. I think we're just going to have a nice steady ramp out through time and remember, these products are both protected into the early 30, so we have plenty of time and it's going well.\n\nWe have Dr. Greenberg, with us who's much closer with the physicians and the nurses that we speak to. Mike maybe want to say a couple of short comments about what you're hearing about the two products.\n\nMike Greenberg\n\nSure, Scott. Thank you. I just like to reiterate the feedback that you shared. On the medical affairs side, we've been hearing exactly the same, exactly the same thing. So regarding BARHEMSYS, we're starting to see some real-world evidence percolate into meetings and being published, that data echoes what we've seen in our pivotal trials. And in fact, in some cases surpasses it. So this is a drug that really seemed to be over delivering at this point, at least to a certain extent, on the BYFAVO side, was a great increase in accounts that are using BYFAVO as well. And again, the feedback has been extraordinary, helping patient throughput, patients are being sedated for their procedures more rapidly, waking up alert and moving on to the very high level of satisfaction in both the health care providers. And for the patient's medical affairs team was really excited about these products, and some of the sales team.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nSo conclusion, Brandon, I would say that we're just expecting nice steady growth over the next several years and many quarters and it compounds. And if you just keep having really nice solid growth like this quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter, you can see where these two products build in a relatively short period of time. And what we've been stating, as we project where the company is going. Fortunately, the products that we sell today are doing rather well, right, another strong quarter. We've had several strong quarters of performance now with the products that we sell, '23 is probably going to be another very strong year for the company that gives us time to build the foundation of BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO. And you can just see if this growth continues by the time you get to '24, '25 and '26. These products can start to be a very significant portion of our earnings and our growth. So far, less than a year into the acquisition, recently having all the territories at full strength we're pretty excited and pleased about where we are so far and where we're going.\n\nBrandon Folkes\n\nRight Thanks. One more for me just a clarifying question on the prior question. I mean, talk about the fact that you're working with lenders for an acquisition, does this imply you have a target that you're ready to move on right now? Or are you subject to the financing? Or are you just trying to line up the financing, so you can move quickly, when you do find a suitable target? That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nYes. There's not much more Brandon, we can say about that, other than the fact that we've been talking about it for a while, and this is just trying to convey to everybody that we are working diligently and we're very focused. We believe we're in a very unique situation, right? As the industry starts to unfold, if we just take a step back, when we acquired Acacia, there were 70 people in that organization and we were able to just run that business with 20, not the full 70 that they had. And the way we've built our infrastructure here at Eagle and the way we've prudently managed our cash and our balance sheet, we believe that we can make a very significant acquisition relative to our size and have similar reduction in cost. And so we can probably take in another large product, probably more in the oncology space than the hospital space right now, and probably bring in a really tremendous amount of synergy when we bring -- if we bring a company into the organization. And it's a unique situation that we find ourselves in, one, having the infrastructure to be able to take advantage of the synergy. And two, having the financial wherewithal to make a rather large accretive situation. And so based on the historical, positive situation we find ourselves in right now, having those factors come together, we have to be aggressive, we need to take advantage of it. It's an opportunity, we can't pass for our shareholders. And so we're very focused, we'll just have to see how things unfold over time here. But the message is, we do take this seriously and we are trying our best to be able to bring a company into Eagle and take advantage of all of this.\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from David Amsellem with Piper Sandler.\n\nDavid Amsellem\n\nThanks. So just a couple. Can you size up the opportunity for landiolol, and more interested in particular how you think about the initial ramp here? So that's number one. Number two is, I know, there's a lot you can't say. But can you about the acquisition or what you're contemplating. But I guess the question here is just thinking more broadly, are you still very much wedded to the hospital space given just the financial pressures that we're seeing in the space? Do you want to think more expansively about the business? Or is this mainly just hospital focused? Thank you.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nDavid, thank you, for all of that. Let's take the second question first and talk a little bit more about the acquisition. We just spent a lot of time speaking about the BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO situation. And it does, it takes a lot of effort. And we're very pleased with the ramp. And we have the hospital business that I would call more saturated right now because we do have the two products that we're in launch mode for. And then as you bring up in your first question, we have the landiolol situation coming up once it's approved.\n\nAnd so I would say it's probably more likely that an acquisition that we make in the short-term, would fall more in the oncology space, then it would in the hospital space. Mostly, the oncology business right now is just a wonderful place to be in the country. We think we can help a number of patients and at the same time, help our shareholders, but it's the oncology side of our business where we have so much room from an infrastructure standpoint.\n\nI think, if I can try to explain this, the clearest way I can, we can probably bring a significant oncology product into our company right now, without needing a heck of a lot of additional expense. I don't mean direct marketing from that standpoint, but the infrastructure that we have could probably support a large oncology product with a minimal amount of additional spending. And so that's the situation we need to take advantage of.\n\nSo if we're able to do what we're hoping to do, it's likely -- it's more likely to be on the oncology side and the hospital side right now. And that goes into your landiolol question, right? We will launch it, it will ramp that's the way these products work. And it'll be the same type of ramp that you normally see in the hospital space. It'll just fortify what we have, we'll see how that goes. But we are very concentrated right now in oncology.\n\nThank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Scott Tarriff for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nScott Tarriff\n\nWell, thank you, everyone for joining the call today. Clearly, obviously, we believe we're poised for another solid year in '23. We look forward to updating you as we advance our business plans. We think we have really a very strong vision of the future. Let's see how it unfolds. And as always, we appreciate your ongoing support for Eagle. Thank you, everybody and stay well.\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

The stock, which listed at ₹1,300 apiece, ended at ₹1,424, nearly 32% higher than the offer price. Analysts remain bullish about the stock's prospects but recommend traders locking in profits for now.\n\nAt Tuesday's closing price, Mankind Pharma was valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 43 times its FY22 earnings. Mankind is now India's fifth largest pharma company by market value of ₹57,046 crore. Sun Pharma, Divi's Lab, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Cipla are currently valued between ₹75,284 crore and ₹2.31 lakh crore.\n\nThe ₹4,326-crore public issue of Mankind Pharma - the biggest IPO in 2023 so far- was subscribed 15.32 times. It was an offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders.\n\nThe IPO was the largest ever by a domestic drug maker since Gland Pharma came up with its ₹6,480 crore public issue in November 2020.\n\n\"The healthcare sector was a laggard over the last one year but started seeing traction over the last two months as the monthly pharma data showed improvement. Mankind received a good response from its anchor clients given its domestic-focused business with strong brand recall in chronic and consumer healthcare segments,\" said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.",

            "body": "Dr Reddy's is poised to reap the benefits of brand sales of Rs 275 crore, which will incrementally boost its headline numbers for Q4.\n\nDr Reddy's Laboratories is scheduled to report its earnings for the fourth quarter on May 10. According to a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, revenue is expected to come in at Rs 6,090.5 crore, translating to a 12 percent year-on-year increase.\n\nConsolidated net profit for the drugmaker is seen at Rs 1,093.6 crore, a significant jump from Rs 87. 5 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The company is also poised to benefit from brand sales of Rs 275 crore, which will incrementally boost its headline numbers for Q4. During the quarter, Dr Reddy's sold nine dermatology brands to Eris Lifesciences.\n\nPrabhudas Lilladher expects a healthy rise in US sales year-on-year, aided by gRevlimid and other new launches to support the drugmaker's earnings growth for the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to BNP Paribas, the domestic formulation may also support, amid expectations of double-digit revenue growth in the segment.\n\nA slew of brokerages, including Axis Securities, ShareKhan, and JM Financial Services, also anticipate Dr Reddy's to be an earnings leader within the entire pharma pack.\n\n\"We expect companies like Dr Reddy's Laboratories to surpass the industry growth due to their superior product portfolio and strong product pipeline for the future,\" Axis Securities stated in its report.\n\nOn the operational front, margins may soften sequentially with lowering gRevlimid sales but are still likely to remain firm on a year-on-year basis, led by an improved product mix, as per Philip Capital.\n\nIn sync with this view, the EBIDTA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin for Q4 is seen at 24.9 percent, showing an expansion of 333 basis points year-on-year but declining 552 bps sequentially.\n\nHowever, Sharekhan also highlights that increased scrutiny from the US Food and Drug Administration, leading to production delays, and rising guidance around research and development and promotion and marketing costs in the near term, could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance for the drugmaker.\n\nAdditionally, Prabhudas Lilladher believes the management's commentary on margins and US sales, excluding the generic Revlimid, will remain key monitorable.",

Broader markets were also under pressure due to cautiousness among investors.\n\nMost of the major sectoral indices declined in early trade, including heavyweight Nifty Financial Services and Nifty Bank.\n\nSome of the top gainers on the Nifty 50 were IndusInd Bank, Power Grid Corporation, Britannia, Tata Motors and HDFC Life. On the other hand, the top losers were UPL, SBI Axis Bank, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Bajaj Finserv.\n\nAlso Read | Sensex, Nifty end flat as investors await key macro data; bank stocks fall\n\nThe decline in domestic markets comes after both benchmark indices gained for several trading sessions, which analysts had attributed to improvement in global cues and a strong Q4 earnings season led by financials and auto sector companies.\n\nHowever, analysts had also highlighted several headwinds that could hurt sentiments in the medium term. This included high interest rates, the inflation trajectory and the fears of a possible recession in the US.\n\nDomestic investors seem to be taking a cautious approach as they wait for key macroeconomic data from the US (consumer prices data) and India (April inflation data). Apart from this, several companies will report their Q4 results later in the day and these are also expected to have an impact on market movement.",

            "body": "Stock prices of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Dr Reddy's Laboratories will be in focus on Thursday after their Q4 numbers. In the fourth quarter of FY23, L&T missed expectations in terms of revenue, while operation performance stood healthy amidst challenges. In case of Dr Reddy's, the drug maker witnessed a mixed bag with multi-fold rise in PAT on year-on-year but sequentially the performance was bitter. Among the common factors is that both L&T and Dr Reddy's have declared a hefty dividend for shareholders.\n\nBoth the share prices tumbled on Wednesday. On BSE, L&T stock ended marginally lower to ₹2366.75 apiece, while Dr Reddy's share price closed at ₹4868 apiece down by 1.3%.\n\nL&T Q4 results:\n\nIn Q4FY23, the infrastructure major earned a consolidated PAT and revenue of ₹3,987 crore and ₹58,335 crore respectively --- registering a growth 10% YoY each. EBITDA came in at ₹6,833 crore, up by 5% YoY, while EBITDA margin contracted to 11.7% in the quarter.\n\nAlso, in the quarter, L&T's order book stood at ₹76,099 crore, registering a growth of 3% YoY, while international orders came in at ₹36,046 crore constituting 47% of the total.\n\nFor shareholders, the company's board of directors on Wednesday recommended a final dividend of ₹24 per equity share subject to approval of shareholders. In FY22, the company paid a dividend of 1100% aggregating to ₹18 per share to the shareholders from its net profit.\n\nRead here: L&T Q4 results: Consolidated PAT rises 10% YoY to ₹3,987 cr, declares dividend of ₹24 per share\n\nOn the performance, Khadija Mantri, Associate VP Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, \"L&T's Q4FY23 consolidated numbers were below our estimates. Revenue/OPM/ PAT fell short of expectations by 3.3%/~30 bps/~6%. Consolidated revenues grew by ~10% y-o-y to ₹58,335 crore. Revenue growth was driven by energy and hi-tech manufacturing segments, while its largest- infrastructure segment grew at a moderate pace of 5% y-o-y.\"\n\nMantri also said, \"Operating profit increased at a slower pace by ~5% y-o-y to ₹6,833 crore. OPM, thus, came in lower by 60 bps y-o-y to 11.7%. Net profit grew by ~10% y-o-y to ₹3,986 crore aided by higher other income. The company reported 19% y-o-y growth in order inflows surpassing its guidance of 12-15% growth. The order inflow for the quarter and year stands at Rs76,072 crore/ ₹2,30,528 crore respectively. Order book grew by 12% y-o-y to ₹3,99,526 crore.\"\n\nMoreover, Amit Anwani - Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher said, L&T's saw a healthy operational performance amidst challenges. He highlighted that L&T's consolidated sales grew 10.4% YoY to ~Rs583.4 billion (up 17.3% YoY; PL estimate/ consensus estimate of ~Rs590 billion/Rs589 billion), driven by revenue growth in segments such as Infrastructure (up ~4.3% YoY; Rs315.5 billion), IT & Technology services (up 21.9% YoY; Rs107bn), Energy Projects (up 17% YoY; Rs79.3 billion), Hi-Tech Manufacturing (up 24.6% YoY; Rs23.2 billion), Development Projects (up 12.4% YoY; Rs12.3 billion) and Financial Services (up 5.2% YoY; Rs31.2 billion).\n\nAnwani also mentioned that margins declined YoY in infrastructure (6.6% vs 8.4% in Q4FY22), Hi-Tech Manufacturing (16.2% vs 20.4% in Q4FY22) and IT &Tech (16.8% vs 20% in Q4FY22). While energy segment margin expanded to 9.7% vs 8.4% in Q4FY22.\n\nNevertheless, Prabhudas Lilladher's analyst has set a Buy rating on L&T stock with a target price of ₹2,479. He said, At the CMP, the stock is currently trading at PE of 26.9x/22.5xFY24/25E.\"\n\nDrug maker, Dr Reddy's Lab saw a strong growth in Q4 consolidated net profit to ₹959.2 crore rising by 10-folds year-on-year, while revenue jumped by 16% YoY to ₹6,296.8 crore. However, performance was feeble on quarter-on-quarter basis with PAT and revenue down by 23% and 7% respectively.\n\nYear-on-year revenue growth in Q4FY23 was driven by growth in North America (27% YoY), Europe (12% YoY) and India (32% YoY) markets. However, partially impacted due to a decline of 7% YoY in revenues in Emerging Markets. Sequentially, the revenue dipped due to fall in North America (-17% QoQ), and Emerging Markets (-15% QoQ), partially offset by growth in Europe (15% QoQ growth) and India (14% QoQ growth).\n\nOn Dr Reddy's performance, Prathamesh Masdekar, Research Analyst, Stoxbox said, \"the company reported healthy performance on the back of new launches during the quarter. On the revenue side, the North American business (41% of sales) saw robust growth, led by new product launches, increase in volumes and a favorable forex movement, which was partly offset by price erosion.\"\n\nFurther, he said, \"the company added six products in the US during the quarter which will lead to strong growth in US sales in future. The growth trajectory in India (20% of sales) was driven by favorable price variance, new product launches and non-core brand divestment of non-core brands, partly offset by decline in volumes for certain products. Europe (12% of sales) and emerging market (19% of sales) grew by new product launches and increased volumes.\"\n\nGoing ahead, Masdekar added, \"the company will actively look for other new investment avenues for growth across all the business segments.\"",

The hearing for SMBC Aviation Capital's appeal is scheduled for Thursday before the two-member bench made up of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Barun Mitra, according to the cause list.\n\nSeveral aircraft lessors have contacted the DGCA, the aviation authority, in the last week to request the deregistration and repossession of 45 Go First aircraft. These actions come after several lessors, including SMBC Aviation Capital Ltd, Narmada Aviation Leasing, Yamuna Aviation Leasing, GAL MSN, and GY Aviation Lease, expressed their opposition to Go First's petition during a hearing at the NCLT last week.\n\nThe lessors also indicated their intent to file an application under Section 65 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in response to what they deemed as fraudulent or malicious initiation of proceedings.\n\nAccording to a statement made by the NCLT on Wednesday, there is \"no bar in entertaining/ considering/ adjudicating\" a Section 65 application following the start of the insolvency resolution process. \"Keeping in mind the urgency of the instant case, to protect and maximise the value of the assets in line with the objectives of the IBC, employment involved, and the larger public interest, the judicial propriety demands, it will not be apt to wait for the filing of the Section 65 application,\" the NCLT said.\n\nGo First halted operating as of May 3, and the aviation watchdog DGCA on Monday ordered the airline to halt ticket sales pending further instructions. Earlier in the day, the NCLT's Delhi-based principal bench suspended the board of Go First and assigned an interim resolution specialist to handle its business.\n\nMORE NCLT NEWS NCLT Grants Go First's Request For Moratorium And Insolvency Proceedings Indiabulls Real Estate Shares Decline 20% As NCLT Rejects Merger With Embassy Group Spicejet Lessors Seek Deregistration Of Four Aircraft: Report Go First Crisis: Wadia Group May Push For One-Time Settlement Lessors Oppose Go First's Plea And Request DGCA To Deregister 20 Aircraft Go First Insolvency: What Has Transpired So Far?

            "body": "By Koustav Das: Benchmark stock market indices ended Wednesday's trading session with gains as financial stocks rebounded. While investors are waiting for key inflation data due on Friday, it seems the mood remains upbeat in the wake of strong Q4 earnings.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex closed 178.87 points higher at 61,940.20, while the NSE Nifty ended 49.15 points higher to settle at 18,315.10. Broader market indices also witnessed a strong recovery, led by an improvement in sentiments.\n\nMost sectoral indices recovered after falling in early trade, with a strong rebound in Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services stock. Nifty Realty, Nifty Auto, Nifty FMCG and Nifty Oil & Gas also gained.\n\nThe top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were IndusInd Bank, HDFC Life, Power Grid Corporation, Tata Motors and BPCL. On the other hand, the top drags were UPL, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Infosys, Hindalco and Sun Pharma.\n\nSome analysts attributed the volatility in the domestic market to profit booking after both benchmarks witnessed strong gains in recent sessions, supported by robust Q4 earnings.\n\nAt the same time, investors have turned cautious as global markets declined in the wake of US consumer prices and domestic retail inflation data.\n\nA poll of economists conducted by news agency Reuters indicated that retail inflation in April could fall below 5 per cent, thus remaining within the RBI's upper tolerance limit for the second consecutive month.\n\nThe consumer price index-based inflation data for April will be released on Friday.",

            "title": "Best & worst performing sectors and stocks in FY23",
            "body": "The domestic market experienced an adrenaline rush in FY23 due to strong monetary policy stances by global central banks, soaring inflation, and the Russia-Ukraine war. For two fiscal years, FPIs sold equities in amounts of ₹140010 crores in FY22 and ₹37632 crores in FY 23. The Nifty FMCG, Auto, and Bank indices among domestic sectors indices experienced the best performances, while the Nifty Pharma, Energy, Metals, Realty, and IT indices saw the poorest performances in FY23. The NIFTY 50 saw a 2% negative return for the fiscal year while the NIFTY 500 experienced a 3.5% shrink. Unexpectedly, the NIFTY Midcap 100 index had a flat return for the year while NIFTY Next 50 index fell by 9.5% followed by NIFTY Small Cap 250, with a reported decrease of 9% witnessed during FY23.\n\nBanking and financial services, particularly PSU Banks stocks like UCO Bank, Karur Vysya, and Karnataka Bank, ought to be considered among the companies that have fared very well over the past 12 months. In the most recent quarter, these companies' revenues grew by double digits while their earnings more than doubled. This is mostly owing to the drastic reduction in provision that the majority of these banks have made as compared to the same period last year, when it was higher than typical due to the consequences of COVID-19. Also, these banks have experienced a significant improvement in their asset quality, while it is still elevated when compared to banks in the private sector. Stocks from the private sector like South Indian Bank and DCB have performed comparatively better than other private sector banks.\n\nUnexpectedly, the FMCG industry has also performed quite well, despite being the one most negatively affected by the significant inflation we all saw over the last year. Mrs. Bector Foods and Speciality, a company from this sector, got listed at the end of 2020. For the last six months, the company's earnings increased by about 50%, owing to the festive season and the introduction of new items and capacity additions. In the 9M FY23 period, the company has already surpassed its FY22 profitability, and there is still one more quarter to go. Throughout the past year, the stock has had a positive return of almost 90%.\n\nSpeaking about the sector that has struggled this year, it would be IT, which was inevitable given the stellar returns the industry has produced since COVID began and through FY22. There have however been a few exceptions; firms like Cigniti Tech and KPIT Tech have had outstanding financial results. While KPIT increased its profits by more than 30% in a very difficult climate for the sector, Cigniti saw virtually a doubling of its earnings during the past several quarters. In the 9M FY23 timeframe, both of these businesses have already surpassed their FY22 earnings.\n\nNifty IT & Nifty Metals have been two of the worst performing sectors as expected due to economic headwinds being faced by global markets over the past 1 year. With rising interest rate hike cycle now almost at the end of the cycle, investors should buy quality IT & metal stocks like Infosys, TCS & Tata Steel which are now available at very attractive valuations. As US & European markets eventually settle down, FY24 should be much better for these two sectors this year.\"\n\nNifty PSU bank & Nifty FMCG have been the two stellar performers in FY23. A rising interest rate cycle has benefitted banks and especially PSU banks in general which has led to an excellent performance driven by stronger margins. However, FY24 could be tougher for PSU banks as a halt in interest rate hikes and investors moving on to banks with superior asset quality like ICICI, Kotak & HDFC bank could spell a below average year for PSU banks in FY24. In the FMCG space, ITC returns could be much lower this year as compared to FY23 as a gradual pick up in the consumption cycle especially in the second half of FY24 should lead to stronger buying in HUL, Nestle, Marico than ITC.\n\nAs of 2023, India's economy is expected to continue to grow, and the stock market is likely to reflect this growth. However, the performance of individual sectors and stocks can vary depending on various factors. This article will discuss the best and worst-performing sectors/stocks in India for the financial years 2023/24.\n\nTechnology: The technology sector in India has been performing exceptionally well in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue in 2023/24. The sector includes companies that are involved in software development, IT services, and hardware manufacturing. Some of the top-performing companies in this sector include Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, and HCL Technologies. The sector's growth is driven by the increasing adoption of digital technology and the shift toward cloud computing.\n\nHealthcare: The healthcare sector in India is also expected to perform well in the financial years 2023/24. This sector includes companies involved in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, hospitals, and healthcare services. Some top-performing companies in this sector include Sun Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Apollo Hospitals, and Fortis Healthcare. Due to an aging population, the sector will likely benefit from increased government spending on healthcare and rising demand for healthcare services.\n\nConsumer Goods: The consumer goods sector in India is also expected to perform well in 2023/24. This sector includes companies that produce and distribute fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as food, beverages, personal care products, and household items. Some of the top-performing companies in this sector include Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, ITC, and Britannia Industries. The sector will likelybenefit from rising consumer demand, especially in rural areas.\n\nReal Estate: The real estate sector in India has been struggling in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue in 2023/24. The sector includes companies involved in developing, selling, and leasing residential and commercial properties. Some of the top companies in this sector include DLF, Sobha, Godrej Properties, and Oberoi Realty. The sector faceschallenges such as oversupply, rising interest rates, and sluggish demand due to rise in interest rates.\n\nInfrastructure: The infrastructure sector in India is also expected to face challenges in 2023/24. The sector includes companies developing roads, highways, airports, and other infrastructure projects. Some of the top companies in this sector include Larsen & Toubro, IRB Infrastructure, AdaniPorts, and SEZ. The sector is facing challenges such as delays in project execution, funding issues, and regulatory hurdles.\n\nBanking: The banking sector in India has faced challenges in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue in 2023/24. The sector includes public and private banks providingbanking and financial services. Some of the top banks in India include the State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank. The sector faces rising non-performing assets (NPAs), increased competition, and regulatory challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the performance of sectors and stocks in the Indian stock market can vary depending on various factors. While some sectors and stocks will likely perform well in the financial years 2023/24, others may face challenges. Investors should carefully analyze the performance of individual sectors and stocks before making investment decisions.\n\nSome of the best performing stocks are TVS Motors, ITC, M&M, Cummins India and Bank of Baroda and the worst performing stocks are Adani Green, Heritage Foods, MphasiS, Lux Industries and Thyrocare Technologies.\n\nThe Best sectors are FMCG, Auto, Banks and the worst Performing Sectors are IT and Pharma.\n\nThough broader markets are flat and for smaller caps it has declined, there is a large deviation among stocks which explains why Indian stock market is still a stock pickers market. For example, stocks like Brightcom Group, which is held by many mutual funds, lost 85% of its value in last 12 months. Similarly, stocks like Tanla solution which powers Airtel's digital ledger technology to approve sms headers lost 63% of its value and a popular company like 8K miles lost almost 57% of the value. Sectorally specialized IT services seems to be one of the most impacted while some of the top performing stocks like Goldstart which manufactures durables is up more than 450% and food or consumer staples like edible oils given constraints of food supply chain has performed upto 800%.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the markets in the recent quarter, there have been notable performances from defensive sectors, including food & beverages, tobacco, healthcare equipment, and consumer durables. These sectors have benefited from stable consumer spending, leading to positive returns. The general industrial sector has also seen positive returns, buoyed by the central government's capex push.\n\nTo capitalize on these top-performing sectors, our outperforming screener identifies high-growth stocks such as ITC, Siemens, Varun Beverages, Polycab India, and KEI Industries. However, sectors such as commercial services, utilities, media, and retailing have underperformed, with the utilities sector facing significant corporate governance issues related to the Adani group. Consequently, our underperforming screener includes stocks such as Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, which have underperformed the Nifty 500 by more than 50 percentage points.\n\nIn light of these trends, it is essential to appreciate the significance of sectoral analysis and company-specific issues when investing in the stock market. By keeping an eye on the best and worst-performing sectors and stocks, investors can make informed decisions that align with their investment objectives.\n\nThere are business cycles and there are market cycles. I believe that one should focus on the former as the latter can generally whiplash you. Some of sectors that I believe have fundamental tailwinds are those such as infra given the government's focus, energy transition given the inflationary pressures caused by conflict, and sectors that should be gaining traction due to the China +1 story.",

            "title": "Nifty at 18,000: How different is the market now versus October 2021?",
            "body": "Indian equities finally managed to reverse their three-month-long losing streak, with bellwether Nifty50 breaking 18,000 levels for the second time this year. Its attempt to scale beyond 18000 levels since October 2021, when it scaled this milestone the first time, did not meet much success except for the second half of 2022. Since the beginning of 2023, the index has been on a slippery path.\n\nWhile the rally's sustainability remains to be seen, the Nifty 50 has recovered by over 7 per cent from its March 2023 low level of 16,950. Interestingly every time the market has tried to move past 18,000 levels, it has been quite a struggle for the market, given the global recessionary concerns, inflation worries, rate hikes and other adverse geopolitical developments.\n\nBut what has changed between October 2021, when Nifty first breached 18,000? Which stocks have aided the rally this time and then?\n\nThe October 2021 rally was largely led by banking stocks such as HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, ruling at new highs then. Banking stocks got a boost from the hopes of economic recovery and credit growth improvement, post easing of covid related curbs.\n\nStocks such as ITC and auto majors such as Maruti failed to participate in the 2021 rally, thanks to the post covid impact and high raw material prices as food and other industrial commodity prices hit the roof in 2021-22.\n\nInterestingly, the Nifty's journey this time has been driven by the stocks that did not participate in the 2021 rally. To understand the contributors to this rally, we have considered the prices of Nifty stocks now (as of 3 May 2023), their 52-week high price and price as on 13 October 2021.\n\nOur analysis reveals that of the 50 stocks that are part of the Nifty 50, 17 stocks, constituting about a third of the index, are trading close to their 52-week high price, with the deviation being under 5 per cent. Topping the list is the stock of drug maker Dr Reddy's Laboratories and ITC Limited. Other stocks include Nestle India, Bajaj Auto, HDFC twins, and Tata Motors. PSU stocks have contributed to the rally this time, including ONGC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Power Grid Corporation and NTPC. In terms of themes that have led the rally this time, it is FMCG, Oil and Gas, PSU stocks and in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and banking, it is specific stocks that have aided the rally, instead of a broad-based rally, covering all stocks in the sector. For instance, While Dr Reddy's is trading close to its 52-week high price, Cipla is about 22 per cent off its one-year high price. Likewise, in banking while ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have done well, Axis Bank is about 11 per cent off its year high. IT, a significant contributor to the Nifty rally in October 2021, has been a laggard this time. Infosys and Wipro are trading at a steep 24 per cent discount to their one-year high price, while TCS has managed to contain the downside relatively well trading 11 per cent lower than its 52-week high levels.\n\nAdani Enterprise is at the bottom, trading 56 per cent below its year-high price. Others include Adani Ports (32 per cent lower), Divi's Laboratories (29 per cent), Bajaj Finserv (27 per cent) and Infosys (24 per cent).\n\nRally not broad-based\n\nWhile Nifty is the key index the country tracks, what is the broad market trend? To understand this better, we have analysed the data of the top 500 listed stocks.\n\nOf the top 500 stocks, about 88 of them are trading about 5 per cent off their year highs. Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Bajaj Auto and Bosch Limited are topping this list. Others in the top 10 stocks close to their 52-week highs include, Alkem Laboratories, HDFC Ltd, Oracle Financial Services, ITC, and Power Finance Corporation. Besides PSUs, several oil and gas companies, including city gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas, are featured in the list, with the current price close to about 5 per cent off its peak. Besides large banks, small finance banks - AU Small Finance Bank also features in the list. While large IT has underperformed market, mid and small IT companies have still managed to do well and buck the weakness, with several of them still trading close to their year highs, including names such as KPIT Technologies, Cyient Ltd and Sonata Software.\n\nAbout 72 stocks are trading 5-10 per cent lower than their year-high prices, while 133 stocks are trading 10-20 per cent lower than their 52-week high prices. About 208 stocks are trading at a 20-88 per cent discount to their 52-week highs.\n\nAmong those trading off their year highs, top on the list is Brightcom Group (88 per cent), Adani Total Gas (76 per cent), Adani Transmission (76 per cent), Adani Green (67 per cent), Tata Tele services (59 per cent) and Gland Pharma (58 per cent) among others. About 13 stocks are trading at over half their October 2021 prices.\n\nOf the 500 stocks, 17 stocks were listed after October 2021. Out of the balance 483 stocks, 213 stocks are trading at prices higher than the October 2021 levels; of these, about 19 stocks have doubled since October 2021. Stocks that have delivered the most since October 2021 include RVNL, Lloyds Metals, Raymond, and several defence stocks such as Mazagon Dock, Bharat Dynamics, and Hindustan Aeronautics. About 20 stocks are trading at half the prices seen in October 2021. About 270 stocks are trading at levels below the October 2021 levels. This points to the fact that the market rally is not broad-based but driven by select themes such as PSU, Oil and gas and FMCG.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 8, 2023",

Dr. Reddy's may elect to expand the scope of the license to cover Australia, New Zealand and nine other countries2.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Junshi Biosciences also grants Dr. Reddy's the exclusive right of first negotiation for commercialization, in the event that Junshi Biosciences determines to grant any third party the rights to commercialize two other products as agreed in the agreement in one or more countries within the total 21 countries of Dr. Reddy's Territory3.\n\nJunshi Biosciences may receive up to an aggregate of US$728.3 million for upfront payment, potential expansion of Dr. Reddy's Territory and milestone payment, plus double-digit percentage of royalties on the net sales of products containing toripalimab.\n\nAbout Toripalimab\n\nToripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 promotes the immune system's ability to attack and kill tumor cells.\n\nMore than forty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally by Junshi Biosciences, including in China, the United States, Southeast Asia, and European countries. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab cover a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.\n\nIn China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI®). Currently, there are six approved indications for toripalimab in China:\n\nunresectable or metastatic melanoma after failure of standard systemic therapy;recurrent or metastatic NPC after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy;locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy;in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as the first-line treatment for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic NPC;in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced/recurrent or distant metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (\"ESCC\");in combination with pemetrexed and platinum as the first-line treatment in EGFR mutation-negative and ALK mutation-negative, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\").\n\nThe first three indications have been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) (2022 Edition). Toripalimab is the only anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody included in the NRDL for treatment of melanoma.\n\nIn the United States, the Biologics License Application (BLA) for toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic NPC and toripalimab monotherapy for the second-line or later treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC after platinum-containing chemotherapy is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designations for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC as well as for toripalimab monotherapy in the second or third-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Additionally, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of esophageal cancer, NPC, mucosal melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nIn Europe, marketing authorization applications (MAA) were accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for 1) toripalimab combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic NPC and 2) toripalimab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced/recurrent or metastatic ESCC, in December 2022 and February 2023.\n\nAbout Dr. Reddy's\n\nDr. Reddy's is a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Hyderabad, India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (stock code: RDY), the National Stock Exchange of India (stock code: DRREDDY), and the Bombay Stock Exchange (stock code: 500124).

            "body": "SHANGHAI, China, May 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd (\"Junshi Biosciences\", HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) announced a collaboration with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (\"Dr. Reddy's\") to develop and commercialize toripalimab, the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in Latin America, India, South Africa, and at the election of Dr. Reddy's, also in Australia, New Zealand and other countries.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have established a partnership with Dr. Reddy's while toripalimab's global commercial network has been steadily expanding, reaching more than 50 countries and advancing our mission of being 'In China, For Global,'\" said Dr. Ning LI, Chief Executive Officer of Junshi Biosciences. \"Dr. Reddy's is a well-respected global pharmaceutical company and extends its business over nearly 70 countries worldwide, achieving impressive commerical presence across the globe. We hope that in the near future, leveraging Dr. Reddy's partnership and strong presence, our innovative medicines can accelerate access to new geographies and deliver better and more affordable treatment options to even more patients.\"\n\nM.V. Ramana, CEO - Branded Markets (India & Emerging Markets), Dr. Reddy's said, \"We are pleased to partner with Junshi Biosciences to take this important product to more patients. Oncology is a focus area for Dr. Reddy's. This partnership is a further step towards increasing our offerings to patients in oncology as we aim to build a robust and comprehensive portfolio in the segment. We are committed to facilitating access to innovative products as we pursue our goal of serving over 1.5 billion patients by 2030.\"\n\nUnder the license and commercialization agreement, Junshi Biosciences will grant a licence to Dr. Reddy's to develop and exclusively commercialize toripalimab in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Panama, Uruguay, India and South Africa1. Dr. Reddy's may elect to expand the scope of the license to cover Australia, New Zealand and nine other countries2.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Junshi Biosciences also grants Dr. Reddy's the exclusive right of first negotiation for commercialization, in the event that Junshi Biosciences determines to grant any third party the rights to commercialize two other products as agreed in the agreement in one or more countries within the total 21 countries of Dr. Reddy's Territory3.\n\nJunshi Biosciences may receive up to an aggregate of US$728.3 million for upfront payment, potential expansion of Dr. Reddy's Territory and milestone payment, plus double-digit percentage of royalties on the net sales of products containing toripalimab.\n\nAbout Toripalimab\n\nToripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 promotes the immune system's ability to attack and kill tumor cells.\n\nMore than forty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally by Junshi Biosciences, including in China, the United States, Southeast Asia, and European countries. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab cover a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.\n\nIn China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI®). Currently, there are six approved indications for toripalimab in China:\n\nThe first three indications have been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) (2022 Edition). Toripalimab is the only anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody included in the NRDL for treatment of melanoma.\n\nIn the United States, the Biologics License Application (BLA) for toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic NPC and toripalimab monotherapy for the second-line or later treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC after platinum-containing chemotherapy is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designations for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC as well as for toripalimab monotherapy in the second or third-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Additionally, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of esophageal cancer, NPC, mucosal melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nIn Europe, marketing authorization applications (MAA) were accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for 1) toripalimab combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic NPC and 2) toripalimab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced/recurrent or metastatic ESCC, in December 2022 and February 2023.\n\nAbout Dr. Reddy's\n\nDr. Reddy's is a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Hyderabad, India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (stock code: RDY), the National Stock Exchange of India (stock code: DRREDDY), and the Bombay Stock Exchange (stock code: 500124).

            "body": "SHANGHAI, China, May 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd (\"Junshi Biosciences\", HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) announced a collaboration with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (\"Dr. Reddy's\") to develop and commercialize toripalimab, the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in Latin America, India, South Africa, and at the election of Dr. Reddy's, also in Australia, New Zealand and other countries.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have established a partnership with Dr. Reddy's while toripalimab's global commercial network has been steadily expanding, reaching more than 50 countries and advancing our mission of being 'In China, For Global,'\" said Dr. Ning LI, Chief Executive Officer of Junshi Biosciences. \"Dr. Reddy's is a well-respected global pharmaceutical company and extends its business over nearly 70 countries worldwide, achieving impressive commerical presence across the globe. We hope that in the near future, leveraging Dr. Reddy's partnership and strong presence, our innovative medicines can accelerate access to new geographies and deliver better and more affordable treatment options to even more patients.\"\n\nM.V.

Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 promotes the immune system's ability to attack and kill tumor cells.\n\nMore than forty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally by Junshi Biosciences, including in China, the United States, Southeast Asia, and European countries. Ongoing or completed pivotal clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab cover a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.\n\nIn China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI). Currently, there are six approved indications for toripalimab in China:\n\nThe first three indications have been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) (2022 Edition). Toripalimab is the only anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody included in the NRDL for treatment of melanoma.\n\nIn the United States, the Biologics License Application (BLA) for toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic NPC and toripalimab monotherapy for the second-line or later treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC after platinum-containing chemotherapy is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designations for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC as well as for toripalimab monotherapy in the second or third-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Additionally, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of esophageal cancer, NPC, mucosal melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nIn Europe, marketing authorization applications (MAA) were accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for 1) toripalimab combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic NPC and 2) toripalimab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced/recurrent or metastatic ESCC, in December 2022 and February 2023.\n\nAbout Dr. Reddy's\n\nDr. Reddy's is a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Hyderabad, India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (stock code: RDY), the National Stock Exchange of India (stock code: DRREDDY), and the Bombay Stock Exchange (stock code: 500124).

            "body": "Bulls have had a good time since last month in Dalal Street due to continued buying by foreign investors and better corporate earnings. However, a series of events, economic data points, and earnings are due next week, resulting in some likely volatility in markets despite the positive trend. The coming week will include a review by the Bank of England and earnings releases by many Indian companies, along with various macro data points and an MSCI index review. Additionally, investors will watch the primary market as Mankind Pharma is expected to debut.Barring the fall seen on Friday, Dalal Street bulls have had a good time since the last month due to continued buying by foreign investors and largely better corporate earnings.\n\nThe overall trend for the market remains positive, but a series of events, economic data points, and earnings are due next week.\n\nTherefore, some volatility in the markets is likely, according to market participants.\n\n\"Although domestic undertone remains bullish, markets may remain choppy and move in tandem with the global mood,\" said Amol Athawale, technical analyst at Kotak Securities.\n\nHere are the 8 major factors that will drive both bulls and bears on Dalal Street next week:\n\nGlobal Markets\n\nIn early trade, domestic equities will take cues from the trend in global markets. A slew of key economic data points are scheduled to be released in the US, UK, and China. These data points will decide the course of action in the respective markets.\n\nMacro Data\n\nThe consumer price inflation print for April will be released in the US on May 10. Further, the monthly budget statement and initial jobless claims will also be released next week.\n\nIndia will also release its consumer price inflation number for April and industrial production data for March in the coming week.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England is scheduled to meet to review its policy and announce an interest rate decision on May 11. Meanwhile, China will release its trade data on May 9, inflation numbers on May 11, and current account balance on May 12.\n\nQ4 Earnings\n\nThe week ahead will see a plethora of companies releasing their quarterly earnings.\n\nLarsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tata Motors, Cipla, Vedanta, Hindustan Petroleum Corp, Siemens, Godrej\n\nConsumer Products, UPL, Lupin, Pidilite Industries, Canara Bank, Apollo Tyres, and Raymond are a few names.\n\nBesides, companies like Hero MotoCorp, Britannia Industries, Adani Power, and Paytm, which released earnings on Friday, will also see some action in their shares.\n\nCorporate Action\n\nOracle Financial Services stock will trade ex-date on May 9 for the interim dividend of Rs 225 announced by the company.\n\nCoforge and Laurus Labs will trade ex-date for their respective dividends of Rs 19 and Rs 1.20 on May 10.\n\nIndiaMART InterMESH will trade ex-date on May 11 for the Rs 20/share final dividend announced last week.\n\nFII Flows\n\nFrom being the worst-performing market at the start of 2023, India became the best-performing market in April, thanks to the strong foreign institutional money that poured into the domestic market, alongside steady domestic flows.\n\nIn just 7 trading sessions, FIIs have poured $1.9 billion into Indian equities.\n\n\"FPIs are likely to continue buying in India. The appreciation in rupee and good Q4 results will aid in increasing capital flows to India,\" said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nMSCI Rejig\n\nThe MSCI index review for May is scheduled to take place on May 11, and foreign investors will closely track the same to make adjustments to their portfolios.\n\nTwo stocks that will be in focus are Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, as MSCI will reduce the free float for them during the index review.\n\nMSCI sees Adani Total Gas' free float at 14% against 25% earlier. For Adani Transmission, it sees it at 10% against 25% earlier.\n\nFurther, HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation will also be in the limelight as MSCI is expected to add the bank to its largecap segment.\n\nThe addition with an adjustment factor of 0.5 could result in outflows of $150-200 million, according to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.\n\nTechnical Talk\n\nWhile the fall in HDFC twins did weigh on the Nifty 50 and pulled down markets on Friday, the trend hasn't turned bearish. \"We believe that if there is no aberration globally, we may see buying resuming at key supports,\" said Sameet Chavan, head - technical and derivatives, Angel One.\n\nAs far as the levels are concerned, 18000 followed by 17900 are likely to be crucial support levels for the 50-stock index. On the flip side, the sturdy wall once again stands at 18150-18250, Chavan said, adding that it would be interesting to see how things shape up in the first half of the week.\n\nIPO Watch\n\nThe coming week will also have investors' attention in the primary market as Mankind Pharma is likely to debut on Monday, The SME IPOs like De Neer Tools and Innokaiz India will open for subscription next week.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
